the following is a conversation with dan carlin host of hardcore history and common sense podcasts to me hardcore history is one of if not the greatest podcast ever made dan and joe rogan are probably the two main people who got me to fall in love with the medium of podcasting as a fan and eventually as a podcaster myself meeting dan was surreal to me he was not just a mere human like the rest of us since his voice has been a guide through some of the darkest moments of human history for me meeting him was like meeting genghis khan stalin hitler alexander the great and all of the most powerful leaders in history all at once in a crappy hotel room in the middle of oregon it turns out that he is in fact just the human and truly one of the good ones this was a pleasure and an honor for me quick mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts related to the episode first is athletic greens the all-in-one drink that i start every day with to cover all my nutritional bases second is

the most challenging moments in american history to me the way out is through reason and love both require a deep understanding of human nature and of human history this conversation is about both i am perhaps hopelessly optimistic about our future but if indeed we stand at the precipice of the great filter watching our world consumed by fire think of this little podcast conversation as the appetizer to the final meal before the apocalypse if you enjoy this thing subscribe on youtube review 5 stars nappa podcast follow on spotify support it on patreon or connect with me on twitter at lex friedman and now finally here's my conversation with the great dan carlin let's start with the highest philosophical question do you think human beings are fundamentally good or are all of us capable of both good and evil and it's the environment that molds how we uh the trajectory that we take through life how do we define evil evil seems to be a situational eye of the beholder kind of question so if we define evil maybe i can get a better idea of and and that could be a whole show couldn't defining evil but when we say evil what do we mean that's a slippery one but i think there's some way in which your existence your presence in the world leads to pain and suffering and destruction for many others in the rest of the world so you you steal the resources and you use them to create more suffering than there was before in the world so i suppose it's somehow deeply connected to this other slippery word which is suffering as you create suffering in the world you bring suffering to the world but here's the problem i think with it because i i fully see where you're going with that and i understand it the problem is is the question of the reason for inflicting suffering so sometimes one might inflict suffering upon one group of individuals in order to maximize a lack of suffering with another group of individuals or one who might not be considered evil at all might make the rational seemingly rational choice of inflicting pain and suffering on a smaller group of people in order to maximize the opposite of that for a larger group of people yeah that's one of the dark things about i've spoken and read the work of stephen codkin i'm not sure if you're familiar with the historian and he's basically a stalin a joseph stalin scholar and one of the things i realized i'm not sure where to put hitler but with stalin it really seems that he was sane and he thought he was doing good for the world he i i really believe from everything i've read about stalin that he believed that communism is good for the world and if you have to kill a few people along the way if it's like you said the small groups if you have to sort of remove the people that stand in the way of this utopian system of communism then that's actually good for the world and it didn't seem to me that he could even consider the possibility that he was evil he really thought he was doing good for the world and that stuck with me because he's one of the most is to our definition of evil he seems to have brought more evil onto this world than almost any human in history and i don't know what to do with that well i'm fascinated with the concept so fascinated by it that the very first hardcore history show we ever did which was a full 15 or 16 minutes um was called alexander versus hitler and the entire question about it was the motivations right so if you go to a court of law because you killed somebody one of the things they're going to consider is why did you kill them right and if you killed somebody for example in self-defense you're going to be treated differently than if you malicious kill kill somebody maliciously to take their wallet right and in the show we we wondered because you know i don't really make uh pronouncements but we wondered about uh if you believe hitler's writings for example mein kampf uh which you know is written by a guy who's a political figure who wants to get so i mean it's about as as believable as any other political tract would be but in his mind the things that he said that he had to do were designed to for the betterment of the german people right whereas alexander the great once again this is somebody from more than 2000 years ago so with lots of propaganda in the intervening years right but one of the the views of alexander the great is that the reason he did what he did was to for lack of a better word write his name in a more permanent graffiti on the pages of history right in other words to glorify himself and if that's the case does that make alexander a worse person than hitler because hitler thought he was doing good whereas alexander if you believe the interpretation was simply trying to exalt alexander so the the motivations of the people doing these things it seems to me matter i don't think you can just sit there and go the only thing that matters is the end result because that might have been an unintentional byproduct uh in which case that person had you been able to show them the future might have changed what they were doing so were they evil or misguided or wrong or made the wrong you know so and i hate to do that because there's certain people like hitler that i don't feel deserve the benefit of the doubt uh at the same time if you're fascinated by the concept of evil and you delve into it deeply enough you're going to want to understand why these evil people did what they did and sometimes it can confuse the hell out of you you know who wants to sit there and try to see things from hitler's point of view to get a better understanding and sort of commiserate with so um but in fact obviously first history show i'm fascinated with the concept so do you think it's possible if we put ourselves in the mindset of some of the people that have led created so much suffering in the world that all of them had their motivations were had good intentions underlying them no i don't i mean simply because there's so many i mean the law of averages would would suggest that that's not true i guess it is pure evil possible meaning you uh again it's slippery but you the suffering is the goal suffering intentional suffering yeah yes i think that and i think that there's historical figures that that that one could point and but that gets to the deeper question of are these people saying uh do they have something wrong with them are they twisted from something in their youth um you know i mean these are the kinds of things where you start to delve into the psychological makeup of these people in other words is anybody born evil and i actually believe that some people are i think the dna can get scrambled up in ways i think the question of evil is important too because i think it's an eye of the beholder thing i mean if hitler for example had been successful and we were today on the sixth or seventh leader of the third reich since i think his entire history would be viewed through a different lens because that's the way we do things right genghis khan looks different to the mongolians than he does to the residents of baghdad right um and i think so so an eye of the beholder question i think comes into all these sorts of things as you said it's a very slippery question where do you put as somebody who's fascinated by military history where do you put violence as uh as in terms of the human condition is it core to being human or is it just a little uh tool that we use every once in a while so i'm going to respond to your question with a question what do you see the difference being between violence and force let me go farther i'm not sure that violence is something that we have to put up with as human beings forever that we must resign ourselves to violence forever but i have a much harder time seeing us able to abolish force and i there's going to be some ground where if those two things are not the same and i don't know that maybe they are where there's certainly some crossover and the re i think force you know you're an engineer you'll understand this better than i but think about it as a physical law if you can't stop something from moving in a certain direction without pushing back in that same direction i'm not i'm not sure that you can have a society or a civilization without the ability to use a counter force when things are going wrong whether it's on an individual level right a person attacks another person so you step in to save that person um or on uh you know even at the highest levels of politics or anything else a counter force to stop the uh inertia or the impetus of of of another movement so i think that force is is a simple almost law of physics in human interaction especially at the civilizational level i think civilization requires a certain amount of if not violence than force so um and again they've talked i mean it goes back into saint augustine all kinds of christian beliefs about the the proper use of force and people have have philosophically tried to decide between can you have a sort of an ahinsa uh buddhist sort of we you know we would be non-violent toward everything and exert no force or or there's a reason to have force in order to create the space for good uh i think force is inevitable now we can talk and and i've not come up to the conclusion myself uh if there is a distinction to be made between force and violence i mean is is um is a non-violent force enough or is violence when done for the cause of good a different thing than violence done either for the cause of evil as you would say or simply for random reasons i mean we humans lack control sometimes we can be violent for no apparent reason or goal um and that's i mean you look at the criminal justice system alone and the way we we interact with people who are acting out in ways that we as a society have decided is intolerable can you deal with that without force and at some level violence i don't know can you maintain peacefulness without force i don't know just to uh be a little bit more specific about the idea of force do you put force as general enough to include force in the space of ideas so you mentioned buddhism or religion or just twitter i can think of no things farther apart than that okay is uh the battles we do in the space of ideas of um you know the great debates throughout history do you put force into that or do you in this conversation are we trying to right now keep it to just physical force in saying that you you have an intuition that force might be with us much longer than violence i think the two bleed together so um take because it's it's always it's always my go-to example i'm afraid and i'm sure that the listeners all hate it but take take germany during uh the 1920s early 1930s before the nazis came to power and they were always involved in some level of force you know beating up in the streets or whatever it might be but think about it more like an intellectual discussion until a certain point um is that it would be difficult i imagine to keep the intellectual counterforce of ideas from at some point degenerating into something that's more um coercion um counterforce if we want to use the phrases we were just talking about so i think the two are are intimately connected i mean actions follow thought right and at a certain point i think especially when when one is not achieving the goals that they want to achieve through uh peaceful discussion or argumentation or um trying to convince the other side that sometimes the next level of operations is something a little bit more physically uh imposing if that makes sense we go from the intellectual to the physical yeah so it too easily spills over into violence yes and one leads to the other often so you kind of implied uh perhaps a hopeful message but let me ask in the form of a question do you think we'll always have war i think it goes to the force question too so for example um what do you do i mean we're let's let's play with nation states now although i don't know that nation states uh are something we should think of as a permanent constitution forever um but how is one nation state supposed to prevent another nation state from acting in ways that it would see as either detrimental to the global community or detrimental to the interest of their own nation-state um you know and i i think i think we've had this question of going back to ancient times but certainly in the 20th century this has come up quite a bit i mean the whole second world war argument sometimes revolves around the idea of what the proper counterforce should be uh can you create an entity a league of nations a united nations uh a one world entity maybe even that that alleviates the need for counterforce involving mass violence and armies and navies and those things uh i think that's an open discussion we're still having it's good to think through that because um having us like a united nations there's usually a centralized control so there's humans at the top there's committees and uh usually like leaders emerge a singular figures that then can become corrupted by power and it's just a really important it feels like a really important thought experiment and something to really rigorously think through how can you construct systems of government that are stable enough to push us towards less and less war and less and less unstable and another tough war which is unfair of application of force you know it's that's really at the core of the question that we're trying to figure out as humans as our weapons get better and better and better destroying ourselves it feels like it's important to think about how we minimize the over application or unfair application of force there's other elements that come into play too you and i are discussing this at the very high intellectual level of things but there is also a tail wagging the dog element to this so think of a society of warriors a tribal society from a long time ago how much do the fact that you have warriors in your society and that their reason for existing what they take pride in what they train for um what their status in their own civilization how much does that itself drive the responses of that society right um how much do you need war to legitimize warriors um you know that's the old argument that you get to and we've had this in the 20th century too that that the creation of arms and armies creates a an incentive to use them right and and that they themselves can drive that incentive as as a justification for their reasons for existence you know um that's where we start to talk about the interactivity of all these different elements of society upon one another so when we talk about you know governments and war we need to take into account the various things those governments have put into place in terms of systems and armies and things like that to to protect themselves right for reasons we can all understand but they exert a force on your your range of choices don't they it's true you're making me realize that uh in my upbringing and i think i'm bringing of many warriors are heroes you know to me i don't know where that feeling comes from but to sort of uh die fighting is uh it's an honorable way to die it feels like that i've always had a problem with this because as a person interested in military history the distinction is important um and i try to make it at different levels so at base level the the people who are out there on the front lines doing the fighting uh to me those people can be compared with police officers and firemen and people the fire persons um but but i mean people that are are um involved in an ethical uh attempt to perform a task which ultimately uh one can see in many situations as being a savings sort of task right or or if nothing else a self-sacrifice for what they see is the greater good now i draw a distinction between the individuals and the entity that they're a part of a military and i certainly draw a distinction between the military and then the entire for lack of a better word military-industrial complex that that service is a part of i feel a lot less moral attachment to uh to those upper echelons than i do the people on the ground the people on the ground could be any of us and have been in a lot of you know we have a very professional uh sort of military now where it's a very uh a subset of the population but in other periods of time we've had conscription and drafts and and it hasn't been a subset of the population it's been the population right and so it is the society oftentimes going to war and i make a distinction between those warriors and the entities either in the system that they're part of the military or the people that control the military at the highest political levels i feel um a lot less moral attachment to them and i have i'm much harsher about how i feel about them i do not consider the military itself to be heroic and i do not consider the military-industrial complex to be heroic i do think that is a tail wagging the dog situation i do think that draws us into looking at um military endeavors as a solution to the problem much more quickly than we otherwise might and to be honest to tie it all together i actually look at the victims of this as the soldiers we were talking about i mean if you if you set a fire to send firemen into to fight um then i feel bad for the firemen i feel like you've abused the trust that you give those people right so when when people talk about war i always think that the people that we have to make sure that a war is really necessary uh in order to protect are the people that you're going to send over there to fight that the greatest victims in our society of war are often the warriors so i in my mind um you know when we see these people coming home from places like iraq a place where i would have made the argument and did at the time that we didn't belong to me those people are victims and i know they don't like to think about themselves that way because it runs totally counter to the to the ethos but if you're sending people to protect this country's shores those are heroes if you're sending people to go do something that they otherwise probably don't need to do but they're there for political reasons or anything else you want to put in that's not defense related well then you've made victims of our heroes and so i i feel like we do a lot of talk about our troops and our soldiers and stuff but we don't treat them as valuable as we as as the rhetoric makes them sound otherwise we would be more um we would be much more careful about where we put them if you're going to send my son and i don't have a son i have daughters but if you're going to send my son into harm's way i'm going to demand that you really need to be sending him into harm's way and i'm going to be angry at you if you put him into harm's way if he doesn't if it doesn't warrant it and so i have much more suspicion about the system that sends these people into these situations where they're required to be heroic than i do the people on the ground that i look at as um either uh the people that are defending us you know in situations like this you know the second world war for example or or the people that um turn out to be the individual victims of a system where they're just a cog and a machine and the machine doesn't really care as much about them as as the rhetoric and the propaganda would insinuate yeah and uh as my own family history it would be nice if we could talk about there's a gray area in in the places that you're talking about there's a gray area in everything and everything but when that gray area is part of your own blood as it is for me it's it's worth shining a light on somehow sure give me example what you mean so you did a program of four episodes of ghosts of the us front yeah so i was born in the soviet union i was raised in moscow my dad was born and raised in kiev my grandmother who just recently passed away was um uh raised in ukraine she it's a small city on the border between russia and ukraine i have a grandfather born in kiev in kiev the interesting thing about the timing of everything as you might be able to connect as she survived she's the most badass woman of uh i've ever encountered my life and most of the warrior spirit i carry is probably from her she survived polymor the ukrainian starvation of the 30s she was a beautiful teenage girl during the nazi occupation of so she survived all of that and of course family that that everybody you know and so many people died the whole process so and one of the things you talk about in your program is that the gray area is even with the warriors it happened to them just like as you're saying now it uh they didn't have a choice so my my grandfather on the on the other side he was uh a machine gunner uh that was in ukraine that that in the red army in the red army yeah and they through uh like the the statement was that there's i don't know if it's obvious or not but the rule was there's no surrender so you you better die so you i mean you're basically the goal was when he was fighting and he was lucky enough one of the only to survive by being wounded early on is there was a march of uh nazis towards i guess moscow and the whole goal in ukraine was to slow everyth to slow them into the into the winter i mean i view him as such a hero and he believed that he's indestructible which is survivor bias and that you know bullets can't hurt him and that's what everybody believed and of course basically everyone that uh he quickly rose to the ranks let's just put it this way because everybody died it's it's it's it was just bodies dragging these heavy machine guns like always you know i was slowly retreating shooting and retreating shooting and retreating and i don't know he was a hero to me like i always i grew up thinking that he was the one that sort of defeated the nazis right and but the reality that there could be another perspective which is all of this happened to him uh by the incompetence of stalin the incompetent incompetence and uh men of uh the soviet union being used like pawns in a in a shittily played game of chess right so like the one narrative is of him as a victim as as you're kind of describing and it then somehow that's more paralyzing and that's more i don't know it feels better to think of him as a hero and as russia soviet union saving the world i mean that narrative also is in the united states that that uh the united states was key in saving the world from the nazis it feels like that narrative is powerful for people i'm not sure and i carry it still with me but when i think about the right way to think about that war i'm not sure if that's the correct narrative let me suggest something there's a line that uh that a marine named eugene sledge uh had said once and i i keep it on my phone because it's it's it makes a real distinction and he said the front line is really where the war is and anybody even a hundred yards behind the front line doesn't know what it's really like now the difference is is there are lots of people miles behind the front line that are in danger right you can be in a medical unit in the rear and artillery could strike you planes could start i mean you could be in danger but at the front line there are two different things one is um that that and at least and i'm doing a lot of reading on this right now and reading a lot of veterans accounts james jones who wrote uh uh books like from here to eternity fictional accounts of the second world war but he based them on his own service he was at uh guadalcanal for example in 1942. and jones had said that the evolution of a soldier in front line action requires an almost surrendering to the idea that you're going to live that you you you become accustomed to the idea that you're going to die and he said you're a different person simply for considering that thought seriously because most of us don't but what that allows you to do is to do that job at the front line right if you're too concerned about your own life um you become less of a good guy at your job right the other thing that the people in the one in the 100 yards of the front line do that the people in the rear medical unit really don't is you kill and you kill a lot right you don't just oh there's a sniper back here so i shot him it's we go from one position to another and we kill lots of people those things will change you and what that tends to do not universally because i've read accounts from uh red army soldiers and they're very patriotic right but a lot of that patriotism comes through years later as part of the nostalgia and the remembering when you're down at that front 100 yards it is often boiled down to a very small world so your grandfather was it your grandfather grandfather at the machine gun he's concerned about his position and his comrades and the people who he owes a responsibility to and those it's a very small world at that point and to me that's where the heroism is right he's not fighting for some giant world civilizational thing he's fighting to save the people next to him and his own life at the same time because they're saving him too and and that there is a huge amount of heroism to that and that gets to our question about force earlier why would you use force well how about to protect these people on either side of me right their lives um now is there hatred yeah i hated the germans for what they were doing as a matter of fact i uh i got a note from a poll not that long ago and i have this tendency to refer to the nazis right the regime that was and he said why do you keep calling them nazis he says say say what they were they were germans and this guy wanted me to not absolve germany by saying oh it was this awful group of people that took over your country he said the germans did this and there's that bitterness where he says let's not forget you know what they did to us and why and what we had to do back right um so for me when we talk about these combat situations the reason i call these people heroic is because of they're fighting to defend things we could all understand i mean if you come after my brother and i take a machine gun and shoot you and you're going to overrun me i mean you're gonna though that becomes a situation where we talked about counter force earlier um much easier to call yourself a hero when you're saving people or you're saving this town right behind you and you know if they get through your machine gun they're gonna burn these villages they're going to throw these people out in the middle of winter these families that to me is a very different sort of heroism than this amorphous idea of patriotism you know patriotism is a thing that we often get um used with right people people manipulate us through love of country and all this because they understand that this is something we feel very strongly but they use it against us sometimes in order to whip up a war fever or to get people i mean there's a great line and i wish i could remember it in its entirety that herman goering had said about how easy it was to get the people into a war he says you know you just appeal to their patriotism i mean there's buttons that you can push and they take advantage of things like love of country and the way we um the way we have a loyalty and admiration to the warriors who put their lives on the line these are manipulatable things in the human species that reliably can be counted on to move us in directions that in a more um sober reflective state of mind we would consider differently it gets the i mean you get this war fever up and people people wave flags and they start denouncing the enemy and they start signing you know we've seen it over and over and over again in ancient times this happened but the love of country is also beautiful so i haven't seen it in america as much so people in america love their country like this patriotism is strong in america but it's not as strong as i remember even with my sort of being younger the love of the soviet union now was it the soviet union this requires a distinction or was it mother russia what it really was was the communist party okay so it was this it was the system in place okay the system in place like loving i haven't quite deeply psychologized exactly what you love i think you love the that like populist message of the worker of the common man that's common so let me let me draw the comparison then um and i often say this that that the united states like the soviet union is an ideological based society right so you take a country like france it doesn't matter which french government you're in now the french have been the french for a long time right uh it's it's not based on an ideology right whereas what unites the united states is an ideology freedom liberty the constitution this is what draws you know it's the e pluribus unum kind of the idea right this that out of many one well what what binds all these unique different people these shared beliefs this ideology the soviet union was the same way because as you know the soviet union russia was merely one part of the soviet union and if you believe the rhetoric until stalin's time everybody was going to be united under this ideological banner someday right it was a global revolution um so ideological societies are different and to be a fan of the ideological framework and goal i mean i'm a liberty person right i would like to see everybody in the world have my system of government which is part of a of a bias right because they might not want that but i think it's better for everyone because i think it's better for me at the same time when the ideology if you consider and you know this stems from ideas of the enlightenment and there's a bias there so my bias are toward the but you feel and this is why you say we're going to bring freedom to iraq we're going to bring freedom to here we're going to bring freedom because we think we're spreading to you something that is just undeniably positive we're going to free you and give you this um it's hard for me to to wipe my own bias away from there right because if i were in iraq for example i would want freedom right but if you then leave and let the iraqis vote for whomever they want are they going to vote for somebody that will i mean you know you look at russia now and i hear from russians quite a bit because so much of my um my views on russia and the soviet union were formed in my formative years and and you know we were not hearing from many people in the soviet union back then but now you do you hear from russians today who will say your views on stalin are archaic and cold you know so so you try to reorient your beliefs a little bit but it goes to this idea of if you gave the people in russia a free and fair vote will they vote for somebody who promises them a free and open society based on enlightenment democratic principles or will they vote for somebody we in the u.s would go what are they doing they're voting for some strong man who's just good you know so um i think it's very hard to throw away our own uh biases and and preconceptions and and you know it's an all eye of the beholder kind of thing but when you're talking about ideological societies it is very diff difficult to throw off all the years of indoctrination into the superiority of your system i mean listen in the soviet union marxism one way or another was part of every classroom's you know you could be studying geometry and they'll throw marxism in there somehow because that's what united the society and that's what gave it a higher purpose and that's what made it in the minds of the people who were its defenders a superior morally superior system and we do the same thing here in fact most people do but see you're still french no matter what what the ideology or the government might be so so in that sense it's funny that there would be a cold war with these two systems because they're both ideologically based systems involving peoples of many different backgrounds who are united under the umbrella of the ideology first of all that's brilliantly put i'm in a funny position that um in my formative years i came here when i was 13 is when i you know teenage is your first love or whatever as i fall in love i fell in love with the american set of ideas of freedom and individuals but i also remember it's like you remember like maybe an ex-girlfriend or something like that i also remember loving as a very different human the the soviet idea like we had the national anthem which is still the i think the most badass national anthem which is the soviet union like saying we're the indestructible nation i mean just the words are so like americans words are like oh we're nice like we're freedom but like a russian soviet union national anthem was like we're bad [ __ ] nobody will destroy us uh i just remember feeling pride in a nation as a kid like dumb not knowing anything because we all had to recite the stuff it was um there's a uniformity to everything there's pride underlying everything i didn't think about all the destructive nature of the bureaucracy the incompetence the of you know all the things that come with the implementation of communism especially around the 80s and 90s but i i remember what it's like to love that set of ideas so i'm in a funny place of like remember like switching the love because i'm you know i kind of joke around about being russian but you know my my long-term monogamous relationship is not with the idea the american ideal like i'm stuck with it in my mind but i remember what it was like to love it and i and i i think about that too when people criticize china or they criticize the current state of affairs with how stalin is remembered and how putin is to know that the you can't always wear the american ideal of individualism radical individualism and freedom in analyzing the ways of the world elsewhere like in china in russia that it does if you don't take yourself too seriously as americans all do as i do it's it's kind of a beautiful love to have for your government to believe in the nation to let go of yourself and your rights and your freedoms to believe in something bigger than yourself that's actually uh that's a kind of freedom that's you're actually liberating yourself if you think like life is suffering you're you're giving into the flow of the water the flow the way of the world by giving away more power from yourself and giving it to what you would conceive as as the power of the people together together we'll do great things and really believing in the ideals of um what in that in this case i don't even know what you would call russia but whatever the heck that is authoritarian powerful state powerful leader believing that can be uh as beautiful as believing the american ideal not just that let me add to what you're saying i'm very i spend a lot of time trying to get out of my own biases uh it is it is a fruitless endeavor long term but you try to be better than you normally are one of the critiques that china and i always you know as an american i tend to think about this as their government right this is a rationale that their government puts forward but what you just said you know is actually if you can make that viewpoint beautiful is kind of a beautiful way of approaching it the chinese would say that what we call human rights in the united states and what we consider to be everybody's birthright around the world is instead western rights that's the words they use western rights it's a it's a fundamentally western oriented and i'll go back to the enlightenment enlightenment based ideas um on what constitutes the rights of man and they would suggest that that's not internationally and always applicable right that you can make a case and again i don't believe this this runs against my own personal views but that you could make a case that the collective well-being of a very large group of people outweighs the individual needs of any single person especially if those things are in conflict with each other right if you cannot provide for the greater good because everyone's so individualistic well then really what is the better thing to do right to suppress individualism so everybody's better off um i think trying to recognize how someone else might see that is important if we want to you know you had talked about eliminating war we talk about eliminating conflict uh the first need to do that is to try to understand how someone else might view something differently than yourself um i'm famously one of those people who buys in to the ideas of of traditional americanism right and look what a lot of people who who live today i mean they would seem to think that things like um patriotism requires a belief in the strong military and all these things we have today but that is a corruption of traditional americanism which viewed all those things with suspicion in the first hundred years of the republic because they saw it as an enemy to the very things that americans celebrated right how could you have freedom and liberty and individualistic um expression if you had an overriding military that was always fighting wars and and the founders of this country looked to other examples like europe for example and saw that standing militaries for example standing armies were the enemy of liberty well we have a standing army now um and and one that is totally interwoven in our entire society if you could if you could go back in time and talk to john quincy adams right early president of the united states and show him what we have now he would think it was awful and horrible and somewhere along the line the americans had lost their way and forgotten what they were all about but we have so successfully interwoven this modern uh military industrial complex with the the traditional uh benefits of the american system and ideology so that they've become intertwined in our thinking whereas 150 years ago they were actually considered to be at opposite polarities and a threat to one another um so when you talk about the love of the nation i tend to be suspicious of those things i tend to be suspicious of government i tend to tend to try very hard to not be manipulated and i feel like a large part of what they do is manipulation and propaganda and so um i think a healthy skepticism of the nation state is actually 100 americanism in the traditional sense of the word but i also have to recognize as you so eloquently stated americanism is not necessarily universal at all and so i think we have to try to be more understanding see our the the traditional american viewpoint is that if a place like china does not allow their people individual human rights then they're being denied something they're being denied and 100 years ago they would have said they're god given rights man is born free and if he's not free it's because of something done to him right the government has taken away his god-given rights i'm getting excited just listening to that well but i mean but i mean i think i think the idea that this is universal is in and of itself a bias now do i want freedom for everybody else i sure do but the people in the soviet union who really bought into that wanted the workers of the world to unite and not be exploited by you know the the greedy blood-sucking people who worked them to death and pocketed all of the fruits of their labor if you frame it that way that sounds like justice as well you know so it is an eye of the beholder sort of thing i'd love to talk to you about vladimir putin sort of while we're on this feeling and wave of empathy and trying to understand others that are not like us one of the reasons i started this podcast is because i believe that there's a few people i could talk to some of it is ego some of it stupidity is there some people i could talk to that not many others can talk to the one person i was always thinking about was vladimir putin do you still speak the language i speak the language very well that makes it even easier i mean you might be you might be appointed for that job that's the context in which i'm asking you this question what are your thoughts about vladimir putin from historical context have you studied him have you thought about him yes uh studied as a is a loaded word um here's here's and again i i find it hard sometimes to not filter things through an american lens so as an american i would say that the russians should be allowed to have any leader that they want to have but what an american would say is but there should be elections right so if the russians choose vladimir putin and they keep choosing him that's their business where where as an american i would have a problem is when that leader stops letting the russians make that decision and we would say well now you're no longer ruling by the consent of the governed you've become the equivalent of a person who may be oppressing your people you might as well be a dictator right now there's a difference between a freely elected and re-elected and re-elected and re-elected dictator right if that's what they want and and look i i it would be silly to broad brush the russians like it would be silly to broad-brush anyone right millions and millions of people with different opinions amongst them all but they seem to like a strong person at the helm and listen there's a giant chunk of americans who do too um in their own country but an american would say as long as the freedom of choice is is given to the russians to decide this and not taken away from them right it's one thing to say he was freely elected but a long time ago and we've done away with elections since then is is a different story too so my attitude on on vladimir putin is if that's who the russian people want and you give them the choice right if he's only there because they keep electing him that's a very different story when he stops offering them the option of choosing him or not choosing him that's when it begins to look nefarious to someone born and raised with the mindset and the ideology that is an integral part of of yours truly and that i can't you know you can see gray areas and nuance all you like but it's hard to escape as you wish and you you alluded to this too it's hard to escape what was indoctrinated into your bones in your formative years uh it's like exit you know your bones are growing right and you can't go back so to me this is so much a part of who i am that i have a hard time jettisoning that and saying oh no vladimir putin not being elected anymore it's just fine i'm too much of a product of my upbringing to go there does that make sense yeah absolutely but of course there's like what we're saying there's gray areas which is i believe i have to think through this but i think there is a point at which adolf hitler became the popular choice in nazi germany in the 30s there's a in in the same way from an american perspective you can start to criticize some in a shallow way some in a deep way the way that putin has maintained power is by controlling the press so limiting one other freedom that we americans value which is the the freedom of the press or freedom of speech that he it is very possible now things are changing now but for most of his presidency he was the popular choice and sometimes by far and you know i have i actually don't have real family in russia who don't love putin i the only people who write to me about putin and not liking him are like sort of activists who are young right but like to me they're strangers i don't know anything about them the people i do know have a big family in russia they love putin they do they miss elections would they want the choice to prove it at the ballot box and and or or are they so in love with him that they're they wouldn't want to take a chance that someone might vote him out no they don't think of it this way and they are aware of the incredible bureaucracy and corruption that is lurking in the shadows which is true in russia right everywhere everywhere but like there's something about the russian it's a remnants it's corruption is so deeply part of the russians so the soviet system that even the overthrow of the soviet the the the breaking apart of the soviet union and uh putin coming and reforming a lot of the system it's still deeply in there and and they're aware of that that's part of the like the love for putin is partially grounded in the fear of what happens when the corrupt take over the greedy take over and they they see putin as the stabilizer as like a hard like force that says counterforce counterforce like get your [ __ ] together like basically from the western perspective putin is is terrible but from from the russian perspective putin is is the only thing holding this thing together before it goes if it collapses now the from the like gary kasparov has been loud on this you know a lot of people from the western perspective say well if it has to collapse let it collapse you know that's easier said than done when you don't have to live through that exactly and so anyone worrying about their family about and they also remember the the inflation and the economic instability and the suffering and the starvation that happened in the 90s with the collapse of the soviet union and they saw the kind of reform and the economic vibrancy that happened when putin took power that they think like this guy's holding it together and they see elections as potentially being mechanisms by which the corrupt people can manipulate the system unfairly as opposed to letting the people speak with their voice they somehow figure out a way to uh manipulate the elections to elect somebody uh like one of them western revolutionaries and so i think one of the beliefs that's important to the american system is the belief in the electoral system that the voice of the people can be heard in the various systems of government whether it's judicial whether it's uh uh i mean basically the assumption is that the system works well enough for you to be able to uh elect the popular choice okay so there's a couple of things that come to mind on that the first one has to do with the idea of oligarchs um there's a belief in political science uh you know it's not the overall belief but but that every society is sort of an oligarchy really if you break it down right so what you're talking about are some of the people who would form an oligarchic class in in in russia and that putin is the guy who can harness uh the power of the state to keep those people in check the problem of course in a system like that a strong man system right where you have somebody who can who can hold the reins and steer the ship when the ship is violently in a storm is the succession so if you're not creating a system that can operate without you then that terrible instability and that terrible future that you that you justified the strong man for is just awaiting your future right i mean unless unless he's actively building the system that will outlive him and allow successors to do what he's doing then then what you've done here is create a temporary i would think a temporary stability here because it's the same problem you have in a monarchy right um where where you have this one king and he's particularly good or you think he's particularly good but he's going to turn that job over to somebody else down the road and the system doesn't guarantee because no one's really worked on and again you would tell me if if putin is putting into place i know he's talked about it over the years putting into place a system that can outlive him and that will create the stability that the people in russia like him for when he's gone because if the oligarchs just take over afterwards then one might argue well we had 20 good years you know of stability but i mean i would say that if we're talking about a ship of state here the guy steering the ship maybe if you want to look at it from the russian point of view has done a great job maybe just saying but the rocks are still out there and he's not going to be at the helm forever so one would think that his job is to make sure that there's going to be someone who can continue to steer the ship for the people of russia after he's gone now let me ask because i'm curious and and ignorant so uh is he doing that do you think is he setting it up so that when there is no putin the state is safe from the beginning that was the idea whether one of the fascinating things now i read every biography english written biography on putin so i haven't i need to think more deeply but one of the fascinating things is how did power change vladimir putin he was a different man when he took power than he is today i actually in many ways admired the man that took power i think is he's very different than stalin and then hitler at the moment they took power i think hitler and stalin were both in our previous discussion already on the trajectory of evil i think putin was a humble loyal honest man when he took power the man he is today is worth thinking about and studying i'm not sure that that that's an old line though about absolute power corrupting absolutely but it's you know it's kind of a line uh you know it's it's a beautiful quote but you have to really think about it you know like what does that actually mean like one of the things i i still have to do you know i've been focusing on securing the conversation right so i i've been i haven't gone through a dark place yet because i feel like i can't do the dark thing for too long so i really have to put myself in the mind of putin leading up to the conversation but for now my senses his he took power when yeltsin gave him one of the big sort of acts of the new russia was for the first time in its history a leader could have continued being in power and chose to give away power that was the george washington right in the united states would look at that as absolute positive yeah a sign a sign of good things yes and so that was a huge act and uh putin said that that that was the defining thing that will define russia for the 21st century that act and he will carry that flag forward that's why in rhetoric he after two terms he gave away power to medvedev yeah but it was a puppet right yeah yes but it was but like still the story was being told i think he believed it early on i think he i believe he still believes it but i think he's deeply suspicious of the corruption that looks in the shadows and i i do believe that like as somebody who thinks clickbait journalism is broken journalists annoy the hell out of me hey journalism's working perfectly journalism's broken journalists made things working great so i understand from putin's perspective that journalism journalists can be seen as the enemy of the state because people think journalists write these deep beautiful philosophical pieces about criticizing the structure of government and the proper policy what you know the steps that we need to take to make a greater nation no they they're unfairly take stuff out of context they uh they're critical in ways that's like shallow and not interesting they they call you a racist or sexist or they make up stuff all the time so i can put myself in the mindset of a person that thinks that it is okay to remove that kind of shallow uh fake news voice from the system the problem is of course that is a slippery slope to then you remove all the annoying people from the system and then you change what annoying means which annoying starts becoming a thing that like anyone who opposes the the system i mean i get i get the um the slippery it's obvious it becomes a slippery slope but i can also put myself in the mindset of the people that see it's okay to remove the liars from the system as long as it's good for russia and okay so here in lies and this again the traditional american perspective because we've had yellow so-called yellow journalism since the founding of the republic that's nothing new um but but the problem then comes into play when you remove journalists even you know it's a broad brush thing because but you remove both the the crappy ones who are lying and the ones who are telling the truth too you're left with simply the the approved government journalists right the ones who are toeing the government's line in which case the truth as you see it is a different kind of fake news right it's the fake news from the government instead of the click bait news and oh yeah maybe truth mixed into all that too in some of the outlets the problem i always have with our system here in the united states right now is trying to tease the truth out from all the falsehoods and look i've got 30 years in journalism my job used to be to go through before the internet all the newspapers and and find the i used to know all the journalists by name and i could pick out you know who they were and and and i have a hard time picking out the truth from the falsehood so i think constantly how are people who don't have all this background who have lives or who are trained in other specialties how do they do it but if the government is the only approved outlet for truth a traditional american and a lot of other traditional societies based on these ideas of the enlightenment that i talked about earlier would see that as a disaster waiting to happen or a tyranny in progress does that make sense it totally makes sense and i would agree with you i still agree with you but it is clear that something about the freedom of the press and freedom of speech in today like literally the last few years with the internet is changing and the argument you know you could say that the american system of freedom of speech is is broken because the here's here's the belief i grew up on and i still hold but i'm starting to be sort of trying to see multiple views on it my belief was that freedom of speech results in a stable trajectory towards truth always so like truth will emerge that was my sort of faith and belief that that yeah there's going to be lies all over the place but there will be like a stable thing that is true that's carried forward to the public now it feels like it's possible to go towards a world where nothing is true or truth is is something that groups of people convince themselves of and there's multiple groups of people and the idea of some universal truth as i suppose is the better thing is uh is something that we can no longer exist under like some people believe that the green bay packers is the best uh football team and some people can think the patriots and they deeply believe it to where they call the other groups liars now that's fun for sports that's fun for favorite flavors of ice cream but they might believe that about science about uh various aspects of uh politics various aspects of sort of uh different policies within the function of our government and like that's not just like some weird thing we complain about but that'll be the nature of things like truth is something we could no longer have well let's and let me de-romanticize the american history of this too because the american press was often just as biased just as i mean i always looked to the 1970s as the high water mark of the american journalistic in the post-watergate era where it was actively going after um the abuses of the government and all these things but there was a famous speech very quiet though very quiet given by catherine graham who was a washington post editor i believe and uh i actually somebody sent it to me we had to get it off of a journalism like a jstor kind of thing and she at a at a luncheon um assured that the to the government people at the luncheon don't worry this is not going to be something that we make a trend we're not because the position of the government is still something that was carried you know the the newspapers were the water and the newspapers were the big thing up until certainly the late 60s early 70s the newspapers were still the water carrier of the government right and they were the water carriers of the owners of the newspaper so let's not pretend there was some angelic wonderful time and i'm saying to me because i was the one who brought it up let's not pretend there was any super age of truthful journalism and all that and i mean you go to the revolutionary period in american history and it looks every bit as bad as today right um that's a hopeful message actually so things may not be as bad as they look well let's look at it more like a stock market and that you have fluctuations in the truthfulness or or believability of the press and there are periods where it was higher than other periods the funny thing about the so-called click-bait era and i do think it's terrible but i mean it resembles earlier eras to me so i always compare it to when i was a kid growing up when i thought journalism was as good as it's ever gotten it was never perfect um but it's also something that you see very rarely in in other governments around the world and there's a reason that journalists are often killed uh regularly in a lot of countries and it's because they report on things that the authorities do not want reported on and i've always thought that that was what journalism should do but it's got to be truthful otherwise it's just a different kind of propaganda right can we talk about genghis khan genghis khan sure by the way is it genghis khan or genghis khan it's not genghis khan it's either genghis khan or chingas khan so let's go with the genghis khan the only thing i'll be able to say with any certain last certain thing i'll say about it uh it's like i don't know gif versus jif i don't know how i don't know how it ever got started the wrong way yeah so first of all your episodes on uh genghis khan for many people are the favorite it's fascinating to think about events that had so much like in their ripples had so much impact on so much of human civilization in your view was he an evil man this goes to our discussion of evil another way to put it is i've read he's much loved in much part in many parts of the world like mongolia and i've also read arguments that say that he was quite a progressive for the time so where do you put him is he a progressive or is he an evil destroyer of humans as i often say i'm not a historian which is why what i try to bring to the hardcore history podcasts are these sub themes so each show has and they're not i try to kind of soft pedal them so they're not always like really right in front of your face um in that episode the soft pedaling sub theme had to do with what we uh referred to as a historical arsonist and it's because some historians have taken the position that sometimes and and most of this is earlier so historians don't do this very much anymore but these were the wonderful questions i grew up with that blend it's almost the intersection between history and philosophy and the idea was that sometimes the world has become so overwhelmed with bureaucracy or corruption or just stagnation that somebody has to come in or some group of people or some force has to come in and do the equivalent of a forest fire to clear out all the dead wood so that the forest itself can be rejuvenated and and society can then move forward and there's a lot of these periods where the historians of the past will portray these figures who come in and do horrific things as creating an almost service for for mankind right uh creating the foundations for a new world that will be better than the old one and it's a recurring theme and so this was the sub theme of the of the cons podcast because otherwise you don't need me to tell you the story of the mongols but i'm going to bring up the historical arsonist element um and but this gets to how the khan has been portrayed right if you want to say oh yes he cleared out the dead wood and made for a for well then it's a positive thing if you say my family was in the forest fire that he set it you're not going to see it that way um much of what genghis khan is credited with on the upside right so things like religious toleration and you'll say well he was uh religiously the mongols were religious uh religiously tolerant and so this makes them almost like a liberal reformer kind of thing but this needs to be seen within the context of of their empire which was uh very much like the roman viewpoint which is the romans didn't care a lot of time what your local people worshipped they wanted stability and if that kept stability and kept you paying taxes and didn't require the legionaries to come in and and then they didn't care right and and the cons were the same way like they don't care what you're practicing as long as it doesn't disrupt their empire and cause them trouble but what i always like to point out is yes but the khan could still come in with his representatives to your town decide your daughter was a beautiful woman that they wanted in the khan's concubine and they would take them so how liberal an empire is this right so so many of the things that they get credit for as though there's some kind of nice guys may in another way of looking at it just be a simple mechanism of control right a way to keep the empire stable they're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart they have decided that this is the best and i love because the mongols were what we would call a pagan people now i love the fact that they and i think we call it i forgot the term we used it had to do with like they were hedging their bets religiously right they didn't know which god was the right one so as long as you're all praying for the health of the khan we're maximizing the chances that whoever the gods are they get the message right um so i think it's been portrayed as something like a liberal empire and it the idea of mongol universality universality is it's more about conquering the world and it's like saying you know we're going to bring stability to the world by conquering it well what if that's hitler right he could make the same case or hitler wasn't really the world conqueror like that because he wouldn't have been he wouldn't have been trying to make it equal for all peoples but my point being that it kind of takes the positive moral slant out of it if their motivation wasn't a positive moral slant to the motivation and and the mongols didn't see it that way and and i think the way that it's portrayed is like and i always like to use this this this analogy but it's like um shooting an arrow and painting a bullseye around it afterwards right how how do we how do we justify and make them look good in a way that they themselves probably and unless we don't have the mongol point of view per se i mean there's something called the secret history of the mongols and there's things written down by mongolian overlords through people like persian and chinese scribes later we don't have their point of view but it sure doesn't look like this was an attempt to create some wonderful place where everybody was living a better life than they were before i i think that's that's later people uh putting a nice rosy spin on it so but there's an aspect to it maybe you can correct me because i'm projecting sort of my idea of what it would take to to uh to conquer so much land is uh the ideology is emergent so if i were to guess the mongols started out as exceptionally as warriors who valued excellence in skill of killing not even killing but like the the actual practice of war and it can start out small you can grow and grow and grow and then in order to maintain the stability of the things over which of the conquered lands you developed a set of ideas with which you can like you said establish control but it was emergent and it seems like the core first principle idea of the mongols is just to be excellent warriors that felt that felt to me like the starting point it wasn't some ideology like with hitler and stalin with hitler the there was an ideology that didn't have anything to do with with war underneath it it was more about conquering it feels like the mongols started out more organically i would say it's emerg like this phenomenon started emergently and they were just like similar to the native americans with the comanches like the different warrior tribes that joe rogan's currently obsessed with at the that what led me to look into it more they they seem to just start out just valuing the skill of fighting whatever the tools of war they had which were pretty primitive but just to be the best warriors they could possibly be make a science out of it is that is that crazy to think that there was no ideology behind it in the beginning i'm gonna back up a second i'm reminded of the lines said about the romans that they create a wasteland and call it peace that is wow that but but but there's a lot of conquerors like that right um where where uh you you will sit there and listen historians forever have it's it's the trait it's the famous trade-offs of empire and they'll say well look at the trade that they facilitated and look at you know the religion all those kinds of things but they come at the cost of all those peoples that they conquered forcibly and and and by force integrated into their empire the one thing we need to remember about the mongols that makes them different than say the romans and this is complex stuff and way above my pay grade but i'm fascinated with it and it's more like the comanches that you just brought up is that the mongols are not a settled society okay they are they are they come from a nomadic tradition now several generations later when you have a kubila khan as as the as the emperor of china it's it's beginning to be a different thing right and the mongols when their empire broke up the ones that were uh in settle the so-called settled societies right iran places like that they will become more like over time the rulers of those places were traditionally and the mongols and say like the the cognate of the golden horde which is still in in their traditional nomadic territories will remain traditionally more mongol but when you start talking about who the mongols were i try to to make a distinction they're not some really super special people they're just the latest confederacy in an area that saw nomadic confederacies going back to the beginning of recorded history the scythians the sarmatians the avars the huns the magyars i mean these are all the nomadic you know the nomads of the eurasian steppe were huge huge players in the history of the world until gunpowder nullified their their traditional weapon system which i've been fascinated with because their traditional weapon system is not one you could copy because you were talking about being the greatest warriors you could be every warrior society i've ever seen values that what this what the nomads had of the eurasian step was this relationship between human beings and animals that changed the equation it was how they rode horses and societies like the byzantines which would form one flank of the step and then all the way on the other side you had china and below that you had persia these societies would all attempt to create mounted horsemen who used archery and they did a good job but they were never the equals of the nomads because those people were literally raised in the saddle they compared them to centaurs the comanches great example considered to be the best horse riding warriors in north america the comanches i always loved watching there's paintings george catlin the famous uh um uh painter who painted the comanches uh illustrated it but the mongols and the scythians and scythians and the avars and all these people did it too where they would shoot from underneath the horse's neck hiding behind the horse the whole way you look at a picture of somebody doing that and it's insane this is what the byzantines couldn't do and the chinese couldn't do it was a different level of of harnessing a human animal relationship that gave them a military advantage that could not be copied right it could be emulated but they were never as good right that's why they always hired these people they hired mercenaries from these areas because they were incomparable right so the combination of people who were shooting bows and arrows from the time they were toddlers who were riding from the time they were who rode all the time i mean they were the huns were bow-legged the romans said because they were never out they ate slapped everything in the saddle that creates something that is difficult to copy and it gave them a military advantage uh you know i enjoy reading actually about uh when that military advantage ended so 17th and 18th century when the chinese on one flank and the russians on the other are beginning to use firearms and stuff to break this military power of these of these various cons um the mongols were simply the most dominating and most successful of the confederacies but if you break it down they really formed the nucleus at the top of the pyramid of the apex of the food chain and a lot of the people that were known as mongols were really lots of other tribes non-mongolian tribes that when the mongols conquer you after they killed a lot of you they incorporated you into their confederacy and often made you go first you know you're going to fight somebody we're going to make these people go out in front and suck up all the arrows before we go in and finish the job so to me and i guess a fan of the mongols would say that the difference and what made the mongols different wasn't the weapon system or the fighting or the warriors or the armor or anything it was genghis khan and if you go look at the other really dangerous from the outside world's perspective dangerous step nomadic confederacies from past history was always when some great leader emerged that could unite the tribes and you see the same thing in native american history two degree two um you had people like attila right or uh there was one called twomin you go back in history and these people make the history books because they caused an enormous amount of trouble for their settled neighbors that normally i mean chinese byzantine and persian approaches to the steppe people were always the same they would pick out tribes to be friendly with they would give them money gifts hire them and they would use them against the other tribes and generally byzantine especially in chinese diplomatic history was all about keeping these tribes separated don't let them form confederations of large numbers of them because then they're unstoppable attila was a perfect example the huns were another large the turks another large confederacy of these people and they were devastating when they could unite so the diplomatic policy was don't let them that's what made the mongols different is genghis khan united them and then unlike most of the tribal confederacies he was able they were able to hold it together for a few generations to linger on the little thread they started pulling on this man genghis khan that was a leader yeah what do you think makes a great leader maybe if you have other examples throughout history and great again let's lose that use that term loosely now he's gonna ask for a definition great uniter of whether it's evil or good it doesn't matter is there somebody who stands out to you alexander the grace talking about military or ideologies you know some people bring up fdr or or i mean it could be the founding fathers of this country or we can go to uh was he mana uh man of the century up there hitler of uh the 20th century and stalin and these people had really uh amassed the amount of power that probably has never been seen in the history of the world is there somebody who stands out to you by way of uh trying to define what makes a great uniter great leader in one man or a woman maybe in the future it's an interesting question and one i've thought a lot about because let's take alexander the great as an example because alexander fascinated the world of his time fascinated ever since people have been fascinated with the guy but alexander was a hereditary monarch right yeah he he was handed the kingdom which is fascinating right but he did not need to rise from nothing to get that job in fact he reminds me of a lot of other leaders of frederick the great for example in prussia these are people who inherited the greatest army of their day alexander unless he was in imbecile was going to be great no matter what because i mean if you inherit the wehrmacht you're going to be able to do something with it right alexander's father may have been greater philip uh he philip ii was the guy who who literally did create a a strong kingdom from a disjointed group of people that were continually beset by their neighbors he's the one that reformed that army uh took things that he had learned from other uh greek leaders like the theban leader at pemanandes um and and then laboriously over his lifetime stabilized the frontiers built this system he lost an eye doing it he he he his leg was made lame i mean he this was a man who looked like he built the empire and led from from the front ranks i mean um so and then and then who may have been killed by his son we don't know who assassinated philip um but then handed the greatest army the world had ever seen to his son who then did great things with it you see this this pattern many times so in my mind i'm not sure alexander really can be that great when you compare him to people who arose from nothing so the difference between what we would call in the united states the self-made man or the one who inherits a fortune there's an old line that you know it's a slur but uh it's about rich people and it's like he was born on he was born on third base and thought he hit a triple right um philip was born at home plate and he had to hit alexander started on third base and so i try to draw a distinction between them genghis khan is tough because there's two traditions the tradition that we grew up with here in the united states and that i grew up learning was that he was a self-made man but there is a tradition and it may be one of those things that's put after the fact because a lot a long time ago whether or not you had blue blood in your veins was an important distinction and so the distinction that you'll often hear from mongolian history uh is that this was a a nobleman who had been deprived of his inheritance so he was a blue blood anyway i don't know which is true uh there's certainly i mean when you look at a genghis khan though you have to go that is a wicked amount of things to have achieved uh he's very impressive as a figure attila is very impressive as a figure um hitler's an interesting figure he's one of those people cuz you know the more you study about hitler the more you wonder where the defining moment was because um if you look at his life i mean hitler was a relatively common soldier in the first world war i mean he was brave he got uh he got some decorations in fact the highest decoration he got in the first world war was given to him by a jewish officer and it was uh he often didn't talk about that decoration even though it was the more prestigious one because it would open up a whole can of worms you didn't want to get into but hitler's i mean if you said who was hitler today one of the top things you're going to say is he was an anti-semite well then you have to draw a distinction between general regular anti-semi-semitism that was pretty common in the era and something that was a rabid level of anti-semitism but hitler didn't seem to show a rabid level of anti-semitism until after or at the very end of the first world war so if this is a defining part of this person's character and and much of what we consider to be his his evil stems from that what happened to this guy when he's an adult right he's already fought in the war to change him so i mean it's almost like the old there was always a movie theme somebody gets hit by by something on the head and their whole personality changes right i mean it almost seems something like that so i don't think i call that necessarily a great leader to me the interesting thing about hitler is what the hell happened to a non-descript person who didn't really impress anybody with his skills and then in in the 1920s it's all of a sudden as you said sort of the man of the hour right so that to me is kind of fast i have this feeling that genghis khan and we don't really know was an impressive human being from the get-go and then he was raised in this environment with pressure on all sides so you start with this diamond and then you polish it and you harden it his whole life hitler seems to be a very unimpressive gemstone most of his life and then all of a sudden so i mean i don't think i can label great leaders and i'm always fascinated by that idea that and i'm trying to remember who the quote was by that that great men oh lord acton so great men are often not good men uh and that in order to be great you would have to jettison many of the moral qualities that we normally would consider a jesus or a gandhi or you know these these qualities that one looks at as as the good upstanding moral qualities that we should all aspire to as examples right the buddha whatever it might be um those people wouldn't make good leaders because what you need to be a good leader often requires the kind of choices that a true philosophical diogenes moral man wouldn't make yeah um so i don't have an answer to your question how about that that's a very long way of saying i don't know just linger a little bit it does feel like from my study of hitler that the time molded the man versus genghis khan where it feels like he the man molded his time yes and i feel that way about a lot of those nomadic uh confederacy builders that they really seem to be these figures that that stand out as extraordinary for one in one way or another remembering by the way that almost all the history of them were written by the enemies that they so mistreated that they were probably never going to get any good press they didn't write themselves that's a caveat we should always yeah basically nomadic or native american peoples or tribal peoples anywhere generally do not get the advantage of being able to write the history of their heroes okay i've uh i've recently almost done with the rise in the fall of the third reich it's one of the historical descriptions of hitler's rise to power nazis rise to power there's a few philosophical things i'd like to uh ask you to see if you can help like one of the things i think about is how does one be a hero in 1930s nazi germany what does it mean to be a hero what do heroic actions look like i think about that because i think about how i move about in this world today you know that we live in really chaotic intense times where i don't think you want to draw any parallels between nazi germany and modern day in any of the nations we can think about but it's not out of the realm of possibility that authoritarian governments take hold authoritarian companies take hold and i'd like to think that i could be in my little small way and inspire others to take the heroic action before things get bad and i kind of try to place myself in what would 1930s germany look like is it possible to stop a hitler is it even the right way to think about it and how does one be a hero in it i mean you often talk about that living through a moment in history is very different than looking at that history looking you know when you look back i also think about it would it be possible to understand what's happening that the bells of war are are are ringing uh it seems that most people didn't seem to understand on you know late into the 30s that war is coming that's fascinating on the united states side inside germany like the opposing figures the german military didn't seem to understand this maybe off the other country certainly france and england didn't seem to understand this that kind of tried to put myself into 90s 30s germany as i'm jewish which is another little twist on the whole like what would i do what should one do do do you have interesting answers so earlier we had talked about putin and we had talked about patriotism and love of country and those sorts of things in order to be a hero in nazi germany by our views here you would have had to have been anti-patriotic to the average germans viewpoint in the 1930s right you would have to have opposed your own government and your own country and that's a very it would be a very weird thing to go to people in germany and say listen the only way you're going to be seen as as a good german and a hero to the country that will be your you know enemies is we think you should oppose your own government it's it's a strange position to put the people in a government in saying you need to be against your leader you need to oppose your government's policies you need to oppose your government you need to hope and work for its downfall that doesn't sound patriotic it wouldn't sound patriotic here in this country if you if you made a similar argument i will go away from the 1930s and go to the 1940s to answer your questions there's movements like the white rose movement in germany which involved young people really and from various backgrounds religious backgrounds often who worked openly against the nazi government at a time when power was already consolidated the gestapo was in full force and they execute people who are against the government and these young people would go out and distribute pamphlets and many of them got their heads cut off with guillotines for their trouble and they knew that that was going to be the penalty that is a remarkable amount of bravery and sacrifice and willingness to die and almost not even willingness because they were so open about it it's almost a certainty right um that's incredibly moving to me so when we talk and we had talked earlier about sort of the human spirit and all that kind of thing there are people in the german military who opposed and worked against hitler for example but to me that's almost cowardly compared to what these young people did in the white rose movement because those people in the in the vermont for example who were secretly trying to undermine hitler they're they're not really putting their lives on the line to the same degree um and so i i think when i look at heroes and listen i remember once saying there were no conscientious objectors in in germany as a way to point out to people that you didn't have a choice you know you were going to serve in there and i got letters from jehovah's witnesses who said yes there were and we got sent to the concentration camps those are remarkably brave things it's one thing to have your own um set of of standards and values it's another thing to say oh no i'm going to display them in a way that with this regime that's a death sentence and not just for me for my family right in these regimes there was not a lot of distinction made between father and son and wives that's a remarkable sacrifice to make and and far beyond what i think i would even be capable of and so the admiration comes from seeing people who appear to be more morally profound than you are yourself um so when i look at this i look at that that kind of thing and i just say wow and the funny thing is if you'd have gone to most average germans on the street in 1942 and said what do you think of these people they're going to think of them as traders who probably got what they deserved so that's the eye of the beholder thing it's the power of the state to um to so propagandize values and morality in a way that favors the state uh that you can turn people who today we look at as unbelievably brave and moral and crusading for righteousness and turn them into enemies of the people um so i mean in my mind it would be people like that see i i think so hero is a funny word and we romanticize the notion but if i could drag you back to 1930s germany from 1940s sure i feel like the heroic actions that doesn't accomplish much is not what i'm referring to so there's many heroes i look up to that uh like david goggins for example the the guy who runs crazy distances he runs for no purpose except for the suffering in itself and i think his willingness to challenge the limits of his mind is uh is heroic i guess i'm looking for a different term which is how could hitler have been stopped my sense is that he could have been stopped in the battle of ideas where or people millions of people were suffering economically or suffering because of the betrayal of world war one in terms of the love of country and how they felt they were being treated and a charismatic leader that inspired love and unity that's not destructive could have emerged and that's where the battle should have been fought i would suggest that we need to take into account the context of the times that led to hitler's rise of power and and and created the conditions where his message resonated uh that is not a message that resonates at all times right um it is impossible to understand the the rise of hitler without dealing with the first world war and the aftermath of the first world war and the inflationary terrible depression in germany and all these things and the um dissatisfaction with the weimar republic's government which was often seen as uh as uh something put into which it was put into place by the the victorious powers uh hitler referred to the people that signed those agreements uh that that signed the armistice as the november criminals and he used that as a phrase which resonated with the population this was a population that was embittered and even if they weren't embittered the times were so terrible and the options for operating within the system in a non-radical way seemed totally discredited right you could work through the weimar republic but they tried and it wasn't working anyway and then the alternative to the nazis who were bully boys in the street were communist agitators that to the average conservative germans seem no better so you have three options if you're an average german person you can go with the discredited government put in power by your enemies that wasn't working anyway you could go with the nazis who seemed like a bunch of super patriots calling for uh the restoration of german authority or you could go with the communists and the entire thing seemed like a litany of poor options right and in this realm hitler was able to triangulate if you will um he came off as a person who was going to restore german greatness at a time when this was a powerful message but if you don't need german greatness restored it doesn't resonate right um so the reason that your love idea and all this stuff i don't think would have worked in the time period is because that was not a commodity that the average german was in search of then well it's interesting to think about whether greatness can be restored through mechanisms through ideas that are not so from our perspective today so evil i don't know what the right term is but the war continued in a way so remember that that when germany when hitler is rising to power the french are in control of parts of germany right the ruhr uh one of the main industrial heartlands of germany was occupied by the french so there's never this point where you're allowed to let the hate dissipate right every time maybe things were calming down something else would happen to stick the knife in and twist it a little bit more from the average german's perspective right um the reparations right so if you say okay well we're going to get back on our feet the reparations were crushing these things prevented the idea of love or brotherhood and all these things from taking hold and even if there were germans who felt that way and there most certainly were it is hard to overcome the power of everyone else you know what i always say when people talk to me about humanity is i believe on individual levels we're capable of everything and anything good bad or indifferent but collectively it's different right and in the time period that we're talking about here messages of peace on earth and love your enemies and and and and all these sorts of things were absolutely deluged and overwhelmed and drowned out by the bitterness the hatred and let's be honest the sense that you were continually being abused by your former enemies there were a lot of people in the allied side that realized this and said we're setting up the next war this is i mean they understood that you can only do certain things to collective human populations for a certain period of time before it is natural for them to want to and there are you can see german posters from the region nazi propaganda posters that show them breaking off the chains of their enemies and i mean germany awake right that was the the great um slogan so i think love is always a difficult option and in the context of those times it it was even more disempowered than normal well this goes to the just to linger in it for a little longer the question of the innova inevitability of history do you think hitler could have been stopped do you think this kind of force that you're saying that there was a pain and was building there's a hatred that was building do you think there was a way to avert i mean there's two questions could have been a lot worse and could have been better in in the trajectory of history in the 30s and 40s the most logical see we had started this conversation brings a wonderful bow tie into the discussion and and and buttons it up nicely we had talked about force encounter force earlier uh the most uh obvious and much discussed way that hitler could have been stopped has nothing to do with germans um when he uh re-militarized the rhineland everyone talks about what a couple of french divisions would have done had they simply gone in and contested and this was something hitler was extremely i mean it might have been the most nervous time in his entire career because he was afraid that they would have responded with force and he was in no position to do anything about it if they did so this is where you get the people who say um you know i mean and churchill's one of these people too where they talk about uh that you know he should have been stopped militarily right at the very beginning when he was weak i don't think listen there were candidates in the in the in the catholic center party and others in in the weimar republic that maybe could have done things and it's beyond my understanding of specific german history to talk about it intelligently but i do think that had the french responded militarily to hitler's initial moves into that area that he would have been thwarted and i think he himself believed if i'm remembering my reading um that this would have led to his downfall so the potential see i i what i don't like about this is that it almost legitimizes military intervention at a very early stage to prevent worse things from happening but it might be a pretty clear-cut case but but it should also be pointed out that there was a lot of sympathy on the part of the allies for the fact that you know the germans probably should have germany back and this is traditional german land i mean they were trying in a funny way it's almost like the love and the sense of justice on the allies part may have actually stayed their hand in a way that would have prevented much much much worse things later but if the times were such that the message of a hitler resonated then simply removing hitler from the equation would not have removed the context of the times and that means one of two things either you could have had another one or you could have ended up in a situation equally bad in a different direction i don't know what that means because it's hard to imagine anything could be worse than what actually occurred but history's funny that way and that hitler is always everyone's favorite example of the difference between the great man theory of history and the trends and forces theories of history right the times made a hitler possible and maybe even desirable to some if you took him out of the equation those trends and forces are still in place right so what does that mean if you take him out and the door is still open does somebody else walk through it yeah it's mathematically speaking the uh the probability of charismatic leaders emerge i i'm so torn on that i i'm uh uh at this point here's another way to look at it the institutional um stability of germany in that time period was not enough to push back and there are other periods in german history i mean that hitler arose in arizona in 1913 he doesn't get anywhere because germany's institutional uh power is enough to simply quash that it's the fact that germany was unstable anyway that prevented a united front that would have kept radicalism from getting out of hand does that make sense yes absolutely a tricky question on this just to stay in this a little longer because i'm not sure how to think about it is the world war ii versus the holocaust when we we were talking just now about the way that history unrolls itself and could hitler have been stopped and i i don't quite know what to think about hitler without the holocaust and perhaps in his thinking how essential the anti-semitism and the hatred of jews was it feels to me that i mean i don't know we were just talking about where did he pick up his hatred of the jewish people there's uh there's stories in vienna and so on that it almost is picking up the idea of anti-semitism as a really useful tool as opposed to actually believing it in his core do you think world war ii as it turned out and hitler's as he turned out would be possible without anti-semitism could we have avoided the holocaust or was it an integral part of the ideology of fascism and the nazis not an integral part of fascism because mussolini really i mean mussolini did it to please hitler but it wasn't an integral part what's interesting to me is that that's the big anomaly in the whole question because anti-semitism didn't need to be a part of this at all right hitler had a conspiratorial view of the world he was a believer that the jews controlled things right the jews were responsible for both bolshevism on one side and capitalism on the other they ruled the banks i mean the united states was a jewifide country right uh bolshevism was was a a a jewifide sort of a a political in other words he saw jews everywhere and he had that line about if the jews of europe force another war to germany they'll pay the price or whatever but then you have to believe that they're capable of that that the holocaust is a weird weird sidebar to the whole thing and here's what i've always found interesting it's a sidebar that weakened germany because look at the first world war jews fought for germany right who was the most important and this is a very arguable point but it's just the first one that pops into my head who was the most important jewish figure that would have maybe been on the german side had the germans had a non-anti-semitic well listen that whole part of the style yes it was einstein but the whole i should point out to say germany or europe or russia or any of those things were not anti-semitic is to do injustice to history right pogroms everywhere i mean yes that is it's standard operating procedure what what you see in the hitlerian era is an absolute huge spike right because the government has a conspiracy theory that the jews have it's funny because hitler both thought of them as weak and super powerful at the same time right and and as an outsider people that we can join the whole idea of the blood and how that connects to darwinism and and all that sort of stuff is just weird right a real outlier but einstein let's just play with einstein if there's no anti-semitism in germany or or none above the normal level right um the baseline level um does einstein leave along with all the other uh jewish scientists and i mean and what does germany have as as increased technological and intellectual capacity if they stay right it's something that actually weakened that state it's it's a tragic flaw in in the hitlerian worldview but it was so and and i don't let me you had mentioned earlier like maybe it was not integral to his character maybe it was a wonderful tool for power i don't think so somewhere along the line and really not at the beginning this guy became absolutely obsessed with this with a conspiracy theory and jews and and and he surrounded himself uh with people and theorists i'm going to use that word really really sort of loosely who believed this too and so you have a cabal of people who are reinforcing this idea that the jews control the world that inter he called it international jewry was a huge part of the problem and that because of that they deserved to be punished they were an enemy within all these kinds of things it's a it's a nutty conspiracy theory that the government of one of the most i mean the big thing with germany was culture right they were they were they were a leading figure in in culture and philosophy and all these kinds of things and that they could be overtaken with this wildly wickedly weird conspiracy theory and that it would actually determine things i mean hitler was taking vast amounts of german resources and using it to wipe out this race when he needed them for all kinds of other things to fight a war of annihilation so that is the weirdest part of of the whole nazi phenomenon it's the the darkest possible silver lining to think about is that the holocaust may have been in the hatred of the jewish people may have been the thing that avoided germany getting the nuclear weapons first and is it isn't that a wonderful historical ironic twist that if it weren't so overlaid with tragedy a thousand years from now will be seen as something really kind of funny well that's that's true it's fascinating to think as you've talked so the seeds of his own destruction right the tragic flaw and my hope is this is a discussion i have with my dad as a physicist is that evil inherently contains with it that kind of incompetence so my dad's discussions he's a physicist and engineer his belief is that at this time in our history the reason we haven't had nuclear like uh terrorist uh blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere in the world is that the kind of people that would be terrorists are simply not competent enough at their job of being destructive so like there's a kind of if you plot it the more evil you are the less able you are and by evil i mean purely just like we said uh if we were to consider the hatred of jewish people as evil because it's sort of detached from reality it's like like just this pure hatred of something that's grounded on things you know conspiracy theories if that's evil then the more you sell yourself the more you give in to these conspiracy theories the less capable you are at actually engineering which is very difficult engineering nuclear weapons and effectively deploying them so that's the that's a hopeful message that the destructive people in this world are by their world view incompetent in creating the ultimate destruction i don't agree with that oh boy i straight up don't agree with that so why are we still here why haven't we destroyed ourselves why haven't the terrorists blow it's been many decades why haven't we destroyed ourselves to this point well it's when you say it's been many decades many day that's like saying in the in the life of a 150 year old person uh we've been doing well for a year the problem the problem with all these kinds of equations and it was bertrand russell right the philosopher who said so uh he said it was it's unreasonable to expect a man to walk on a tightrope for 50 years i mean the the the problem is is that this is a long game and let's remember that up until relatively recently what would you say 30 years ago it the nuclear weapons in the world were really tightly controlled that was one of the real dangers in the fall of the soviet union remember the the um the worry that that all of a sudden you were going to have bankrupt former soviet republics selling nuclear weapons to terrorists and whatnot i would suggest and and here's another problem is that when we call these terrorists evil it's easy for an american for example to say that osama bin laden is evil easy for me to say that but one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter as the saying goes and to other people he's not what osama bin laden did and the people that worked with him we would call evil genius the idea of hijacking planes and flying them into the buildings like that and that he could pull that off and that still boggles my mind i'm still it's funny i'm still stunned by that and yet i you know the idea here's the funny part and i don't i i hesitate to talk about this because i don't want to give anyone ideas right but you don't need nuclear weapons to do incredibly grave amounts of danger yes really i mean what one can of gasoline and a bic lighter can do in the right place and the right time and over and over and over again can bring down societies this is the argument behind the importance of the stability that a nation-state provides so when we went in and took out saddam hussein one of the great counter-arguments from some of the people who said this is a really stupid thing to do is that saddam hussein was the greatest anti-terror weapon in that region that you could have because they were a threat to him so he took that and he did it in a way that was much more repressive than we would ever be right and this is the old line about why we supported um uh right-wing death squad countries because they were taking out people that would inevitably be a problem for us if they didn't and they they were able to do it in a way we would never be able to do supposedly we're pretty good at that stuff you know just like the soviet union was behind the scenes and underneath the radar but the idea that the stability created by powerful and strong centralized leadership allowed them it's almost like outsourcing anti-terror activities allowed them to for their own reasons i mean you see the same thing in the syria situation with the assads i mean you can't have an isis in that area because that's a threat to the assad government who will take care of that for you and then that helps us by not having an isis so um i would suggest one that the game is still on on whether or not these people get nuclear weapons uh in their hands i would suggest they don't need them to achieve their goals really uh the the the crazy thing is if you start thinking like the joker in batman the the terrorist ideas it's funny i guess i would be a great terrorist because i'm just full of those ideas oh you could do this it's scary to think of how vulnerable we are but the whole point is that you as the joker wouldn't do the terrorist actions that's the that's the theory that's so hopeful to me with my dad is that all the ideas your ability to generate good ideas what forget nuclear weapons how you can disrupt the power grid how you can disrupt the attack our psychology uh attack like with a can of gasoline like you said somehow disrupt the american system of ideas like that coming up with good ideas there are we saying evil people can't come up with evil genius ideas that's what i'm saying we have this hollywood story i don't think history backs that up i mean i think you can say with the nuclear weapons it does but only because they're so recent yeah but i mean evil genius i mean that's almost proverbial but that's okay so to push back for the fun of it or i don't i don't mean to i don't want you to leave this with a t in a terrible mood because i push back on every hopeful idea but i tend to be a little cynical about that stuff but but that goes to the the definition of evil i think because i'm not so sure human history has a lot of evil people being competent i do believe that they mostly like in order to be good at doing what may be perceived as evil you have to be able to construct an ideology around which you truly believe when you look in the mirror by yourself that you're doing good for the world and it's difficult to construct an ideology where destroying the lives of millions or disrupting the american system i'm already contradicting myself as i'm saying i'm gonna say people have done this already yes so i but but then it's the the question of like about aliens with the the uh idea that if the aliens are all out there why haven't they visited us the same question if it's so easy to be evil not easy if it's possible to be evil why haven't we destroyed ourselves and your statement is from the context of history the game is still on and it's just been a few years since we've found the tools to destroy ourselves and one of the challenges of our modern time we don't often think about this pandemic kind of revealed is how soft we've gotten in terms of our deep dependence on the system so somebody mentioned to me you know what happens if power goes out for a day what happens if power goes out for a month oh for example the person that mentioned this was a berkeley faculty uh that i was talking with he's an astronomer who's observing solar flares and it's very possible that a solar flare they happen all the time to different degrees i've got your cell phones yeah to knock out the power grid for months so like you know just as a thought experiment what happens if just power goes out for a week in this country this is like the e and the electromagnetic magnetic pulses and the nuclear weapons and all those kinds of things yeah but maybe that's an act of nature yes and even just the act of nature will reveal like a little fragility the fragility of it all and then the evil can emerge i mean the kind of things that might happen when power goes out especially during a divisive time well you won't have food at baseline level that would mean that the the uh the entire supplies chain begins to break down and then you have desperation and desperation opens the door to everything can ask a dark question as opposed to the other things we've been talking about there's there's always a thread a hopeful message i think it'll be a hopeful message on this one too you may have the wrong guess um if you were to bet money on the way that human civilization destroys itself or it collapses in some way that is where the result would be unrecognizable to us as anything akin to progress what would you say is it nuclear weapons is it some societal breakdown through just more traditional kinds of war is it engineered pandemics nanotechnology is it artificial intelligence is it something we can't even expect yet do you have a sense of how we humans will destroy ourselves or might we live forever i think what what governs my view of this thing is is the ability for us to focus ourselves collectively right and that gives me the choice of looking at this and saying what are the odds we will do x versus y right um so go look at the 62 cuban missile crisis where uh we looked at the potential of nuclear war and we stared right in the face of that to me i consider that to be you want to talk about a hopeful moment that's one of the rare times in our history where i think the odds were overwhelmingly that there would be a nuclear war and uh i'm not the super kennedy worshiper that you know i grew up in an era where he was especially amongst people in the democratic party he was almost worshiped and i was never that guy but i will say something john f kennedy by himself um probably made decisions that saved a hundred million or more lives because everyone around him thought he should be taking the road that would have led to those deaths and to push back against that is when you look at it now i mean again if you were a betting person you would have bet against that and that's rare right um so so when we talk about how the world will end um the fact that one person actually had that in their hands meant that it wasn't a collective decision it gave remember i said i trust people on an individual level but when we get together we're more like a herd and we devolve down to the lowest common denominator that was something where the higher uh ethical ideas of a single human being could come into play and make the decisions that that influence the events but when we have to act collectively i get a lot more pessimistic so take what we're doing to the planet and we talk about it always now in terms of climate change which i think is far too narrow uh look at you know and and i i always get very frustrated when we talk about these arguments about is it happening is it human just look at the trash forget forget climb it for a second we're destroying the planet because we're not taking care of it and because what it would do to take care of it would require collective sacrifices that would require enough of us to say okay and and we can't get enough of us to say okay because too many people have to be on board it's not john f kennedy making one decision from one man we have to have 85 percent of us or something around the world not just you can't say we're going to stop uh uh doing damage to the to the to the world here in the united states if china does it right so the amount of people that have to get on board that train is hard you get pessimistic hoping for those kinds of shifts unless it's right you know krypton's about to explode we have and so i think if you're talking about a gambling man's view of this that that's got to be the odds on favorite because it requires such a unanim i mean and the systems maybe aren't even in place right the fact that we would need intergovernmental bodies that are completely discredited now on board and you would have to subvert uh the national interests of nation states i mean the the amount of things that have to go right in a short period of time we don't have 600 years to figure this out right so to me that that looks like the most likely just because the things we would have to do to avoid it seem the most unlikely does that make sense yes absolutely i i believe call me naive in just like you said with the individual i believe that charismatic leaders individual leaders will save us like this what if you don't get them all at the same time what if you get a charismatic leader in one country but under or what if you get a charismatic leader in a country that doesn't really matter that much well it's a ripple effect so it starts with one leader and their charisma inspires other leaders like so it's uh it's like one ant queen steps up and then the rest of the ant starts behaving and then there's like little other spikes of leaders that emerge and then that's where collaboration emerges i tend to believe that like when you heat up the system and [ __ ] starts getting really chaotic then the leader whatever this collective intelligence that we've developed the leader will emerge like do you think there's just as much of a chance though that the leader would emerge and say the jews are the people who did all this right you know what i'm saying is that the idea that they would come up you have a charismatic leader and he's going to come up with the rights or she is going to come up with the right solution as opposed to totally coming up with the wrong solution i mean i guess what i'm saying is you could be right but a lot of things have to go the right way but my intuition about the evolutionary process that led to the creation of human intelligence and consciousness on earth results in the the power of like if we think of it just the love in the system versus the hate in the system that the love is greater the human the the the human kindness potential in the system is greater than the human uh hatred potential and so the leader that is in the time when it's needed the leader that inspires love and kindness will is more likely to emerge and will have more power so you have the hitlers of the world that emerge but they're actually in the grand scheme of history are not that impactful so it's it's weird to say but not that many people died in world war ii if you look at the the the the full range of human history uh you know it's uh up to 100 million whatever that is with natural pandemics too you can have those kinds of numbers but it's still a percentage i forget what the percentage is maybe three five percent of the human population on earth maybe it's a little bit focused on a different region but it's not destructive to the entirety of human civilization so the i believe that the the charismatic leaders when time is needed that do good for the world in uh the broader sense of good are more likely to emerge than the ones that say kill all the jews i it's it's possible though and this is just you know i've thought about this all of 30 seconds but i mean uh it it it's we're betting money here on the on the 21st century who's going to win i think maybe uh you've divided this into too much of a black and white dichotomy this love and good on one side and this evil on another let me throw something that might be more in the center of that linear uh a balancing act self-interest which may or may not be good you know good the good version of it we call enlightened self-interest right the bad version of it we call selfishness but self-interest to me seems like something more likely to impact the outcome than either love on one side or evil on the other simply a question of what's good for me or what's good for my country or what's good from my point of view or what's good for my business i mean if you tell me um and maybe i i'm a coal miner or maybe i own a coal mine if you say to me we have to stop using coal because it's hurting the earth i have a hard time disentangling that greater good question from my right now good feeding my family question right so i think i think maybe it's going to be a much more banal thing than good and evil much more a question of we're not all going to decide at the same time that the interests that we have are aligned does that make sense yeah totally but i mean i've looked at ayn rand and objectivism and kind of really thought like how bad or good can things go when everybody's acting selfishly but i think we're just talking two ants here with microphones talking about two seconds but like the the question is when they when this spreads so what what is what do i mean by love and kindness i think it's human flourishing on earth and throughout the cosmos it feels like whatever the engine that drives human beings is more likely to result in human flourishing and people like hitler are not good for human flourishing so that's what i mean by good is they is is there's a i mean maybe it's an intuition that kindness is an evolutionary advantage i hate those terms i hate to reduce stuff to the evolutionary biology always but it just seems like for us to multiply throughout the universe it's good to be kind to each other and those leaders will always emerge to save us from the hitlers of the world that want to kind of burn the thing down with a flamethrower that's the intuition but let's talk about you you brought up evolution several times let me let me play with that for a minute um i think going back to animal times we are conditioned to deal with overwhelming threats right in front of us so i have quite a bit of faith in humanity when it comes to impending doom right outside our door uh if krypton's about to explode i think humanity can r rouse themselves to great and would give power to the people who needed it and be willing to make the sacrifices but that's what makes i think the the pollution slash climate change slash you know screwing up your environment um uh threats so particularly insidious is it happens slowly right it defies fight and flight mechanisms it defies the natural ability we have to deal with the threat that's right on top of us and it requires an amount of foresight that while some people would would be fine with that most people are too worried and understandably i think too worried about today's threat rather than next generations threat or whatever it might be so i mean when we talk about when you had said what do you think the greatest threat is i think with nuclear weapons i think could we have a nuclear war we darn right could but i i think that there's enough of of inertia we're against that because people understand instinctively if i decide to launch this attack against china and i'm india we're going to have 50 million dead people tomorrow whereas if you say we're gonna have a whole planet of dead people in three generations if we don't start now i think the evolutionary uh way that we have have evolved mitigates maybe against that in other words i think i would be pleasantly surprised if we could pull that off does that make sense totally i don't mean to be like the i'm the i'm the scripting doom it's fun that way i think we're both uh maybe i'm over the top on the left maybe i'm over the top on the doom so it makes it makes for a fun chat i think so one one guy that i've talked to several times who's slowly becoming a friend is a guy named elon musk he's a big fan of hardcore history uh especially genghis khan uh series of episodes but really all of it him and his uh his girlfriend grimes listen to it which is i know what you like yeah you know elon okay awesome so that's like relationship goals uh like listen to hardcore history on the weekend with your loved one okay uh so let me if i were to look at the guy from a perspective of human history it feels like he will be a little speck that's remembered oh absolutely you think about like the people what will we remember from our time who are the people will remember whether it's the the hitler's or the einsteins who's going to be it's hard to predict when you're in it but it seems like elon would be one of those people remembered and if i were to guess what he's remembered for it's the work he's doing with spacex and potentially being the person that we don't know but the being the person who launched a new era of space exploration if we look you know centuries from now if we are successful as human beings surviving long enough to venture out into the you know october the stars it's weird to ask you this i don't know what your opinions are but do you think humans will be a multi-planetary species in the arc long arc of history do you think elon will be successful in his dream and he doesn't he doesn't shy away from saying it this way right he really wants us to colonize mars first and then colonize other earth-like planets in other solar systems throughout the galaxy do you have a hope that we humans will venture out towards the stars so here's the thing and this actually again dovetails do what we were talking about earlier i actually first of all i toured spacex and it is when you you it's hard to get your mind around because he's doing what it took governments to do before yes okay so so it's incredible that we're watching individual companies and stuff doing this doing it faster and cheaper yeah well and and and and pushing the envelope right faster than the governments at the time we're moving it's it's it really is i mean there's a lot of people who i i think who think elon is is overrated and you have no idea right when you go see it you have no idea but that's actually not what i'm most impressed with um it's tesla i'm most impressed with and the reason why is because in my mind we just talked about what i think is the greatest threat the environmental stuff and i talked about our inability maybe all at the same time to be willing to sacrifice our self-interests in order for the for the goal and i don't want to put words in elon's mouth so you can you can talk to him if you want to but in my mind what he's done is recognize that problem and instead of building a car that's a piece of crap but you know it's good for the environment so you should drive it he's trying to create a car that if you're only motivated by your self-interest you'll buy it anyway and it will help the environment and help us transition away from one of the main causes of damage i mean one of the things this pandemic and the shutdown around the world has done is show us how amazingly quickly the earth can actually rejuvenate we're seeing clear skies in places species come and you would have thought it would have taken decades for some of this stuff so what if to name just one major pollution source we didn't have the pollution caused by automobiles right and and if if you had said to me dan what do you think the odds of us transitioning away from that were 10 years ago i would have said well people aren't going to do it because it's inefficient it's this it's that nobody wants people but what if you created the vehicle that was superior in every way so that if you were just a self-oriented consumer you'd buy it because you wanted that car that's the best way to get around that problem of people not wanting to i think he's identified that and as he's told me before you know when the last time a car company was created that actually you know blah blah blah he's right and so i happen to feel that even though he's pushing the envelope on the space thing i think somebody else would have done that someday i'm not sure because of the various things he's mentioned how difficult it is to start i'm not sure that the industries that create vehicles for us would have gone where he's going to lead them if he didn't force them there through consumer demand by making a better car that people want it anyway they'll follow they'll copy they'll do all those things and yet who was going to do that so i hope he doesn't hate me for saying this but i happen to think the tesla idea may alleviate some of the need to get off this planet because the planet's being destroyed right and we're going to colonize mars probably anyway if we live long enough and i think the tesla idea not just elon's version but ones that follow from other people is the best chance of making sure we're around long enough to see mars colonized does that make sense yeah totally and one other thing from my perspective because i'm now starting a company i think the interesting thing about elon is he serves as a beacon of hope like pragmatically speaking for people that sort of push back on our doom conversation from earlier that a single individual could build something that allows us as self-interested individuals to gather together in a collective way to actually alleviate some of the dangers that face our world so like it gives me hope as an individual that i can build something that can actually have impact that counteracts the uh the stalins and the hitlers and all the threats that face that human civilization faces that an individual has that power i i didn't believe that the individual has that power in the in the halls of government like i don't feel like any one presidential candidate can rise up and help the world unite the world it feels like from everything i've seen in and you're right with tesla it can bring the world together to do good that's a really powerful mechanism of you know whatever you say about capitalism that you can build companies that start you know it starts with a single individual of course there's a collective that that grows around that but the leadership of a single individual their ideas their dreams their vision can catalyze something that takes over the world and does good for the entire world but if i think but again i i think the genius of the idea is that it doesn't require us to go head-to-head with human nature right he he's he's actually built human nature into the idea by basically saying i'm not asking you to be uh an environmental activist i'm not asking you to sacrifice to make i'm gonna sell you a car you're going to like better and by buying it you'll help the environment that takes into account our foibles as a species and actually leverages that to work for the greater good and that's the sort of thing that does turn off my little doom caster cynicism thing a little bit because you're actually hitting us where we live right you're you're you're not you can take somebody who doesn't even believe the environment's a problem but they want a tesla so they're inadvertently helping anyway i think that's the genius of the idea yeah and i'm telling you that's one way to make love much more efficient mechanism of change than uh hate making it in your self-interest just creating a product that uh least to more love than uh than hate you're gonna want to love your neighbor because you're gonna make a fortune okay there you go that's why he's right i'm on board that's why elon said love is the answer that's i think uh exactly what he meant okay let's try something difficult uh you've uh recorded an episode of steering into the iceberg on your common sense program yeah that has started a lot of conversations it's quite moving it was quite haunting got me a lot of angry emails really of course i did something i haven't done in 30 years i endorsed a political candidate from one of the two main parties and there were a lot of disillusioned people because of that i guess i didn't hear it as an endorsement i just heard it as a the similar flavor of conversation as you have in in hardcore history it's almost the speaking about modern times in the same voice as you speak about when you talk about history so it was just a a little bit of a haunting view of the world today i know we were just wearing our doom doom let me put that right back on are you no the the i like the term doom caster uh is is there is there um how do we get love to win what's the way out of this is there some hopeful line that we can walk to uh to avoid something and i hate to use the terminology but something that looks like a civil war not necessarily a war of force but a a division to a level where it doesn't any longer feel like a united states of america with an emphasis on united is is there a way out i read a book a while back i want to say george friedman the stratfor guy wrote it was something called the next hundred years i think it was called and i remember thinking um i didn't agree with any of it and one of the things i think he said in the book was that you know the united states was going to break up i'm going from memory here he might not have said that at all but something was stuck in my memory about that i remember thinking um but i i think some of the arguments were connected to the differences that we had and the fact that those differences are being exploited so we talked about media earlier in the lack of truth and everything we have a media climate that is incentivized to take the wedges in our society and make them wider and there's no countervailing force to do the opposite or to help to you know so um there was a famous uh memo from a group called project for a new american century and they took it down but the way back machine online still has it and it happened before 9 11 spawned all kind of conspiracy theories because it was saying something to the effect of and i'm really paraphrasing here but you know that the united states needs another pearl harbor type event because those galvanize a country that without those kinds of events periodically is naturally geared towards pulling itself apart and it's those periodic events that act as the countervailing force that otherwise is not there um if that's true then we are naturally inclined towards pulling ourselves apart so to have a media environment that makes money off widening those divisions uh which we do i mean i was in talk radio and and it it has those people the people that used to scream at me because i wouldn't do it but i mean we would have these terrible conversations after every broadcast where i'd be in there with the program director and they're yelling at me about heat heat was the worthy create more heat well what is heat right heat is division right and they want the heat not because they're political they're not republicans or or democrats either they're we want listeners and we want engagement and involvement and because of the constructs of the format you don't have a lot of time to get it so you can't have me giving you like on a podcast an hour and a half or two hours where we build a logical argument and you're with me the whole way your audience is changing every 15 minutes so whatever points you make to create interest and intrigue and engagement have to be knee-jerk right now things they told me once that the audience has to know where you stand on every single issue within five minutes of turning on your show in other words you have to be part of a of a linear set of political beliefs so that if you feel a about subject a then you must feel d about subject d and i don't even need to hear your opinion on it because if you feel that way about a you're going to feel that way about d this is a system that is designed to pull us apart for profit but not because they want to pull us apart right it's a byproduct of the prophet that's one little example of of 50 examples in our society that work in that same fashion so what that project for a new american century document was saying is that we're naturally inclined towards disunity and without things to occasionally ratchet the unity back up again so that we can start from the baseline again and then pull ourselves apart till the next pearl harbor that you'll pull yourself apart which i think was i think that's what the george friedman book was saying that i disagreed with so much at the time um so in answer to your question about civil wars we can't have the same kind of civil war because we don't have a geographical division that's as clear-cut as the one we had before right you had a basically north-south line and some border states it was set up for that kind of a split now we're divided within communities within families within gerrymandered voting districts and precincts right so you can't disengage we're stuck with each other so if there's a civil war now for lack of a better word what it might seem like is the late 1960s early 1970s where you had the bombings and you know let's call it domestic terrorism and things like that because that that would seem to be something that once again you don't even need a large chunk of the country pulling apart ten percent of people who think it's it's the end times can do the damage just like we talked about terrorism before and a can of gas and a big lighter i've lived in a bunch of places and i won't give anybody ideas where a can of gas in a bic lighter would take a thousand houses down before you could blink yeah right um that terrorist doesn't have to be from the middle east doesn't have to have some sort of a fundamentalist religious agenda it could just be somebody really pissed off about the election results so once again if we're playing an odds game here everybody has to behave for this to work right only a few people have to misbehave for this thing to go sideways and remember for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction so you don't even have to have those people doing all these things all they have to do is start retribution cycle and there's an escalation yes and it go and it creates a momentum of its own which leads fundamentally if you follow the chain of events down there to some form of dictatorial government as the only way to create stability right you want to destroy the republic and have a dictator that's how you do and there are parallels to nazi germany the burning of the reichstag that you know blah blah blah i'm the doom caster again all right well and some of it could be manufactured by the those seeking authoritarian power absolutely like the reichstag fire was or the polish soldiers that fired over the border before the invasion in 1939 uh to fight the uh the devil's advocate was an angel's advocate uh i would say just as our conversation about elon it feels like individuals have power to unite us to to be that force of unity so uh you mentioned the media i think you're one of the great podcasters in history joe rogan is a like a long form whatever it's not podcasting it's actually whatever the very infrequent is what it is no matter what it is but the basic process of it is you go deep and you stay deep and the listener stays with you for a long time so i i'm just looking at the numbers like we're almost three hours in and i from previous episodes i can tell you that about 300 000 people are still listening to the sound of our voice three hours in so usually 300 to 500 000 people listen and they too congratulations by the way that's wonderful joe rogan is what like 10 times that and so he has power to unite uh you have power to unite there's a few people with voices that it feels like they have power to unite even if you if you quote unquote endorse a candidate and so on there's still it feels to me that speaking of i don't want to keep saying love but it's love and maybe unity more practically speaking that like sanity that like respect for those you don't agree with or don't understand uh so empathy well just a few voices of those can help us avoid the really importantly not avoid the singular events like you said of somebody starting a fire and so on but avoid the escalation of it the preparedness of the populace to escalate those events to yeah to to turn a singular event in a single riot or a shooting or like even something much more dramatic than that to turn that into something that creates like ripples that grow as opposed to ripples that fade away and so like i would like to put responsibility on somebody like you and uh on me in some small way and joe being cognizant of the fact that a lot of very destructive things might happen in november and a few voices can save us is the feeling i have not by saying we should vote for or any of that kind of stuff but really by being the the voice of calm that like calms the the seas from or whatever the analogy is from boiling up because i i truly am worried about this is the first time this year when i i sometimes i somehow have felt that the american project will go on forever that when i came to this country i just believed and i think i'm young but like you know i have a dream of creating a company that will do a lot of good for the world and i thought that america is the beacon of hope for the world and the ideas of freedom but also the idea of empowering companies that can do some good for the world and i'm just worried about this america that filled me a kid that came from our family came from nothing and from you know russia as it was soviet union as it was to be able to do anything in this new country i'm just worried about it and it feels like a few people can still keep this project going like people like elon people like joe uh is there do you have a bit of that hope i'm watching this experiment with social media right now and i don't even mean social media really expand that out to um i mean i feel like we're all guinea pigs right now watching you know i have two kids and and just watching and there's a three year space between the two of them one's 18 the other is 15. and just you know in when i was a kid a person who was 18 and 15 would not be that different just three years difference more maturity but their life experiences you would easily classify those two people as being in the same generation now because of the speed of technological change there is a vast difference between my 18 year old and my 15 year old and not in a maturity question just in what apps they use how they relate to each other how they deal with their peers uh their social skills all those kinds of things where you turn around and go this is uncharted territory we've never been here so it's going to be interesting to see what effect that has on society now as that relates to your question the most upsetting part about all that is reading how people treat each other online and you know there's lots of theories about this the fact that some of it is just for trolling laughs that some of it is just people are not interacting face to face so they feel free to treat each other that way um and i of course i'm trying to figure out how how if this is how we have always been as people right we've always been this way but we've never had the means to post our feelings publicly about it or if the environment and the social media and everything else has provided a change and changed us into something else um either way when one reads how we treat one another and the horrible things we say about one another online which seems like it shouldn't be that big of deal they're just word but they have a cumulative effect i mean when you uh i was reading um meghan markle who i don't know a lot about because it's it's too much of the pop side of culture for me to pay but i read a story the other day where she was talking about the abuse she took online and how incredibly overwhelming it was and how many people were doing it and you think to yourself okay this is something that people who are in positions of what you were discussing earlier never had to deal with let me ask you something and boy this is the ultimate doom caster thing of all time to say when you think of historical figures that push things like love and peace and um and and creating bridges between enemies when you think of how what happened to those people first of all they're very dangerous every society in the world has a better time easier time dealing with violence and things like that than they do non-violence non-violence is really difficult for governments to deal with for example what happens to gandhi and jesus and martin luther king and you think about all those people right when they're that day it's it's ironic isn't it that these people who push for peaceful solutions are so often killed but it's because they're effective and when they're killed the effectiveness is diminished why are they killed because they're effective and and the only way to stop them is to eliminate them because they're charismatic leaders who don't come around every day and if you eliminate them from the scene the odds are you're not going to get another one for a while i guess what i'm saying is the very things you're talking about which would have the effect you think it would right they would destabilize systems in a way that most of us would consider positive but those systems have a way of protecting themselves right and and so i i feel like history shows see history is pretty pessimistic i think by and large um if only because we can find so many examples that just sound passive but i feel like people who are dangerous to the way things are tend to be removed yes but there's two things to say i feel like you're right that history i feel like the ripples that love leaves in history are less obvious to detect but are actually more transformational like well one could make a case about i mean if you want to talk about the the long-term value of a jesus a gandhi yeah yes those people's ripples are still affecting people today i agree and that's you feel those ripples through the general improvement of the quality of life that we see in throughout the generations like you feel the ripples i'll go along with you on that okay but i would even if that's not true now i tend to believe that and by the way the the company that i'm working on is a competitor is exactly attacking this which is a competitor to twitter i think i can build a better twitter as a first step there's a longer story in there i think a three-year-old child could build it better and that this is not to denigrate you i'm sure yours would be better than a three-year-old but twitter is so and listen facebook to their they're really awful platforms for intellectual discussion and meaningful discussion but and i'm on it so let me just say i'm part of the problem we're new to this so it's not it wasn't obvious at the time how to do it it's now you agree and now a three-year-old can i do i i tend to believe that we live in a time where the tools that people that are interested in providing love like the weapons of love are much more powerful so like the one nice thing about technology is it allows anyone to build a company that's more powerful than any government so that could be very destructive but it could be also very positive and that's i tend to believe that somebody like elon that wants to do good for the world somebody like me and many like me could have more power than any one government to uh and by power i mean the power to affect change which is different from government government and i don't mean to interrupt you but i'll forget my train of thought i'm getting old but i mean how do you deal with the fact that already governments who are afraid of this are walling off their own internet systems as a way to create firewalls simply to prevent you from doing what you're talking about in other words if there's an old line that if voting really changed anything they'd never allow it if if love through a modern day successor to twitter would really do what you wanted to do and this would destabilize governments do you think that governments would would take counter measures to squash that love before it got too dangerous there's several answers one first of all i don't actually to push back on something you said earlier i don't think love is as much of an enemy of the state as as one would think different states have different views i i think the states want power and i don't always think that love is in tension with power like i think and and i think it's not just about love it's about rationality it's reason it's empathy all of those things i don't necessarily think there always have to be by definition in conflict with each other so that's one sense is i feel like basically you can trojan horse love into behind behind uh but you have to be good at it this is the thing is you have to be conscious of the way these states think so the fact that china banned certain services and so on that means the the companies weren't eloquent whoever the companies are weren't actually good at infiltrating like i think isn't that a song like love is a battlefield i think it's all a cat editor yeah it's all a game and you have to be good at the game and just like elon we said you know with tesla and saving uh the environment i mean that's not just by getting on a stage and saying it's important to save the environment is by building a product that people can't help but love and then convincing hollywood stars to love it like there's there's a game to be played okay so let me let me build on that because i i think there's a way to see this i think you're right and so uh it has to do with a story about the 1960s in the vast scheme of things the 1960s looks like a revival of neo-romantic ideas right uh i had a buddy of mine several years well two decades older than i was who was uh in the 60s went to the protest did all those kind of things and we were talking about it and i was romanticizing it and he said don't romanticize he goes let me tell you most of the people that went to those protests and did all those things all they were there was to meet girls and have a good time and you know it was it wasn't so but it became in vogue to have all in other words let's talk about your empathy and love you're never gonna in my opinion grab that great mass of people that are only in it for them they're interested in whatever but if meeting girls for a young teenage guy requires you to feign empathy requires you to read deeper subjects because that's what people are into you can almost as a silly way to be trendy you could make maybe empathy trendy love trendy solutions that that are the opposite of that um the kind of things that people inherently will not put up with you in other words the possibility exists to change the zeitgeist yes and reorient it in a way that even if most of the people aren't serious about it the results are the same does that make sense absolutely okay okay so we've found a meeting of the month yeah yeah exactly creating creating incentives that uh that encourage the best and the most beautiful aspects of feminism it all boils down to meeting girls and boys once again you're getting to the bottom of the evolutionary motivations and you're always on safe ground when you do that yeah that's a little difficult for me of uh you know and i'm sure it's actually difficult for you to to listen to me say complimenting you but uh it's not good it's difficult for both of us okay so but uh you know you and i as i mentioned to you i think off mike been friends for a long time it's just been one way so like i've been away now it's two way is to right now so like that's the beauty of podcasting you know i mean now just been fortunate enough with this particular podcast that i see in people's eyes when they meet me that they've been friends with me for for for a few years now and and we become fast friends actually after we start talking yeah but it's one way in the vet in that first moment uh you know like there's something about your especially hardcore history that uh you know i do some crazy challenges and running and stuff i remember in particular probably don't have time one of my favorite episodes the painfultainment one some people hate that episode because it's too real it's my darkest one we wanted to set a baseline that's the baseline but i remember listening to that and when i ran uh 22 miles for me that was the long distance yeah and uh it just pulls you in and there there's something so powerful about this particular creation that's bigger than you actually that you've created it's kind of interesting i think anything that is successful like that like elon stuff too it becomes bigger than you and that's that's what you're hoping for right yeah absolutely didn't mean to interrupt you i apologize i guess one a question i have if you like look in the mirror but you also look at me what advice would you give to yourself and to me and to other podcasters maybe to joe rogan about this journey that we're on i feel like it's something special i'm not sure exactly what's happening but it feels like podcasting is special what advice and i'm relatively new to it what advice do you have for for people that are carrying this flame and traveling this journey well i'm often asked for advice by new podcasters people just starting out and so i have sort of a a tried and true list of uh do's and don'ts and and but i don't have um advice or suggestions for you or for joe joe doesn't need anything from me joe's figured it out right i mean he hasn't yet he's still a confused kid curious about the world that's but that's the genius of it that's what makes it work right that's what that's what joe's brand is right um i guess what i'm saying is by the time you reach the stage that you're at or joe's at or they don't need they have figured this out the people that sometimes need help are brand new people trying to figure out what do i do with my first show and how do i talk to them and and i have standard answers for that but you found your niche i mean you don't need me to tell you what to do as a matter of fact i might ask you questions about how you do what you do right well there's uh i guess there's specific things like we were uh talking offline about monetization that's a fascinating one very difficult as an independent yeah and uh one of the things that joe is facing with um i don't know if you're paying attention but he joined spotify with a 100 million dollar deal before going exclusive on their platform the idea of exclusivity that one i don't give a damn about money personally but i'm single so and i i like living in a shitty place so i i enjoy it so i guess makes it easier you get the freedom right now you know yeah freedom materials is slate not saving for anybody's college exactly yeah okay so uh on that point but i also okay maybe it's romanticization but i feel like podcasting is pirate radio and when i first heard about spotify partnering up with joe i was like you know [ __ ] the man i i said i i even i drafted a few tweets and so on just like attacking spotify then i'd calm myself down that you can't lock up the special thing we have but then i realized that maybe that these are vehicles for just reaching more people and actually respecting podcasters more and so on so that's what i mean by it's unclear what the journey is because uh you also serve as beacon for now there's like millions 1 million plus podcasters i i i wonder what the journey is do you have a sense um are you at romantic in the same kind of way in feeling that because you have a roots and radio too do you feel that podcasting is pirate radio or is the spotify thing one possible avenue are you nervous about joe as a fan as a friend of joe or is this a it's a good thing for us so my history of how i got involved in podcasting is interesting yes i i i was in radio uh and then i started a company back in the era where the dot-com boom was happening and everybody was being bought up and it just seemed like a great idea right start um i did it with seven other six other people and the whole goal of the company was uh we had we had to invent the term i'm sure everybody there's other places that invented it at the same time but what we were pitching to investors was something called amateur content so this is before youtube before podcasting before all this stuff and i my job was to be the evangelist and i would go to these people and talk and and sing the praises of all the ways that amateur content was going to be great and i never got a bite and they all told me the same thing this isn't going to take off because anybody who's good is already going to be making money at this and i kept saying forget that we're talking about scale here if you have millions of pieces of content being made every week a small percentage is going to be good no matter what right 16 year olds will know what other 16 year old is like and i kept pushing this nobody bit but the podcast grew out of that because in if you're talking about amateur content in 1999 well then you're already where you know you're ahead of the game in terms of not seeing where it's going to go financially but seeing where it's going to go technologically and so when we started the podcast in 2005 and it was the political one not hardcore history um which was an outgrowth of the old radio show um we didn't have any financial um ideas we were simply trying to get our handle on the technology and how you distribute it to people and all that and it was years later that we tried to figure out okay how can we get enough money to just support us while we're doing this and we and the cheap and the easy way was just to ask listeners to donate like a pbs kind of model and that was that was the original model um so then once we started down that we figured out other models and there's the advertising thing and we sell the old shows and so all these became ways for us to support ourselves um but as as podcasting matured and as more operating systems develop and phones were developed and all these kinds of things every one of those developments which actually made it easier for people to get the podcast actually made it more complex to make money off of them yes so while our audience was building the amount of time and effort we had to put into the monetization side began to skyrocket so to get back to your spotify question to use just one example there's a lot of people who are doing similar things um in this day and age you know we just sell mp3 files and all you had to have was an mp3 player it's cheap and dirty now every time there's an os upgrade something breaks for us so we're having i mean my choices are at this point to start hiring staff more staff you know people and then be a human resources manager i mean the pirate radio side of this was the pirate radio side of this because you didn't need anybody but you know you or you and another i mean you could just do this lean and mean and it's becoming hard to do it lean and mean now so if somebody like a spotify comes in and says hey um we'll handle that stuff for you in the past i would just say f off we don't need you yeah i don't mind and i i definitely am not making what we could make on this but what we would have to do to make that is honoris to me but it's becoming onerous to me day to day anyway and so if somebody were to come in and say hey uh we'll pick that up for you we will not interfere with your content at all we won't and in my case you can't say we need a show a month because that ain't happening right so i mean everybody's everybody's uh design is different right so it doesn't you know there's not one size fits all but i guess as a long time pirate podcaster um there are you know we've been looking to partner with people but nobody's right for us to partner with i mean so so i'm always looking for ways to take that side of it off my plate because i'm not interested in that side all i want to do is the shows and the you know it's really at this point you shouldn't call yourself an artist because some you know that's something to be decided by other but i mean we're trying to do art and there's something very satisfying in that but the part that i can't stand is the the increasing amount of time the monetization question takes upon us and so there's a case to be made i guess is what i'm saying that if a partnership with some outside firm enhances your ability to do the art without disenhancing your ability to do the art it's um the word i'm looking for here is it's um it's it's enticing yes uh i don't like big companies um so i'm afraid of of whatever strings might come with that and if i'm joe rogan and i'm talking about subjects that can make company public companies you know a little nervous um i would certainly be careful but at the same time people who are not in this game don't understand the problems that literally i mean just all the operating systems all the podcatchers every time some new podcatcher comes out makes it easier to get the podcast that's something we have to account for on the back end and i'm not exactly the technological wizard of all time so um i think it is maybe maybe the short answer is is that as the medium develops it's becoming something that you have to consider not because you want to sell out but because you want to keep going and it's becoming harder and harder to be pirate-like in this environment the thing that convinced me especially inside spotify is that they understand so if you walk into this whole thing with some skepticism as you're saying of big companies then then it works because spotify understands the magic that makes podcasting or they appear to in part at least they understand enough to respect joe rogan and despite what i don't i don't know if you uh so there's the internet and there's people with opinions on the internet really yes and they have opinions about joe and spotify but the reality is there's two things in private conversation with joe and in general there's two important things one spotify literally doesn't tell joe anything like all the people that think they the spotify somehow pushing joe in this direction contractuals didn't insist upon that it's in the contract but also you know companies have a way of even with the contract i sure do to be you know marketing people hey i know we're not forcing you yeah yeah yeah yeah i hate that yeah but jump with you what you and joe are the same and spotify is smart enough not to send a single email of that kind that's really smart and they leave they leave them be there is meetings inside spotify that like people have read about people complain but those meetings never reached joe that that never that's like company stuff and the idea that spotify is different than pirate radio the the difficult thing about podcasting is nobody gives a damn about your podcast you're alone in this i mean there's fans and stuff but nobody nobody's looking out for you yeah yeah and the nice thing about spotify is they want joe to joe's podcast to succeed even more that's what joe talked about is that's the difference between youtube and spotify spotify wants to be the netflix of podcasting and they like what netflix does is they they they don't want to control you in any way but they want to create a a platform where you can flourish even when your interests are aligned interests are alone so let me bring up let me bring up something that uh let's make a distinction because not all companies who do this are the same and you brought up youtube and spotify but but to me youtube is at least more like spotify than some of these smaller uh the term is walled garden right you've heard the term walls garden okay so um i've been around podcasting so long now that i've seen rounds of consolidation over the years and they come in waves and all of a sudden so you'll get uh and i'm not going to mention any names but but up until recently the consolidation was happening with relatively small firms compared to people like spotify and the problem was is that by deciding to to consolidate your materials in a walled garden you are walling yourself off from audience right um so your choice is i'm going to accept this amount of money from this company but the loss is going to be a large chunk of my audience and that's a catch-22 because you're negotiating power with that company is based on your audience size so signing up with them diminishes your audience size you lose negotiating power but when you get to the level of the spotify to just pick them out there's other players um but you brought up spotify specifically these are people who can potentially potentially enhance your audience over time and so the risk to you is lower because if you decide in a year or two whatever the licensing agreement's term is that you're done with them and you want to leave instead of how you would have been with some of these smaller walled gardens where you're walking away with a fraction of the audience you walked in with you have the potential to walk out with whatever you got in the original deal plus a larger audience because their algorithms and everything are designed to push uh people to your content if they think you'd like so it takes away some of the downside risk which which alleviates and if you can write an agreement like joe rogan i mean where you've protected your your freedom to to put the content out the way you want so and if some of the downside risk is mitigated and if you eliminate the problem of trying to monetize and stay up with the latest tech then it might be worth it i you know i'm scared of things like that but at the same time i'm trying to not be an idiot about it yes and i can be an idiot about it and when you've been doing it as independently for as long as i have the inertia of that uh has a force all its own but i'm i'm i'm inhibited enough in what i'm trying to do on this other end that it's opened me at least to listening to people yes um but um listen at the same time i love my audience and it sounds like a cliche but they're literally the reason i'm here so i want to make sure that whatever i do if i can is in keeping with a relationship that i've developed with these people over 15 years um but like you said no matter what you do you are go because see here's the thing if you don't sign up with one of those companies to make it easier for them to get your stuff on this hand they might yell at you for how difficult it is because the new os the new the new operating system just updated and you just i can't get your so either way you're opening yourself up to ridicule at this point all of that makes it easier to go well if the right deal came along and they weren't screwing me and they weren't screwing my audience and blah blah um you know i mean again in this business when you're talking about cutting edge technology that is ever-changing and as you said a million podcasts and growing i think you have to try to maintain flexibility and especially if they can mitigate the downside risk i think you have to i think you'd be an idiot to not at least try to stay up on the current trends and look i'm watching joe i'm going okay let's see how it goes for joe yeah i mean if if he's like ah this is terrible i'm getting out of this you go okay those people are right you know so joe's put himself out as a guinea pig and i and the rest of us guinea pigs appreciate it as a huge as a fan of your shows and as a fan of netflix the people there i think i can speak for like millions of people in hope that hardcore history comes to netflix or if spotify becomes the netflix of podcasting into spotify there's something at its best that they bring out the you said artists so i can say it is they bring out the best out of the artists they they remove some of the headache and somehow like they they put at their best netflix for example is able to enforce and find the the beauty and the power in the creations that you make even better than you like they don't interfere with the creations but they somehow it's a it's a branding thing probably too interfering would be that would be a no-go for me that's right absolutely that can't help but that's why netflix is masterful they they seem to not interfere with the talent as opposed to i could throw other people under the bus like there's a lot of places under the bus that could be thrown absolutely so i would love i know there's probably people screaming yes right now uh in terms of hardcore history on netflix would be awesome um and i i don't love asking this question but it's asked probably the most popular question that's unanswerable so let me try to ask it in a way that you would actually answer it which is of course you said you don't release shows very often and uh the question is the requests and the questions is what can you tell dan to do one on the civil wars can you tell dan to do one on the napoleon bonaparte can you tell them to do one you know ever every topic and you've spoken to this actually your answer about the civil war is quite interesting i didn't know you knew what my answer but the civil war was that that you don't you as a military historian you enjoy in particular when there is differences in the armies of contrast contrasts as with the civil war which like blew my mind when i heard you say is you know it's there's not an interesting a deep intricate contrast between the two opposings like the roman civil wars which legionary against legionary yeah is and you've also said that you kind of the shows you work on are ones where you have some roots of fundamental understanding about that period and and so like when you work on a show it's basically like pulling at those strings further and like refreshing your mind and learning definitely done the research wow these are like words out of my mouth yeah you're right so but is there something like like shower thoughts on reddit uh is there some ideas that are like lingering in your head about possible future episodes is there things that whether you uh not committing to anything but uh whether you're gonna do it or not is there something that's like makes you think hmm that would be interesting to uh to pull at that thread a little bit oh yeah i i we have things we keep in our back pocket for later so uh blueprint for armageddon the first world war series we did that was in my back pocket the whole time and when the centennial of the war happened it just seemed to be the likely time to bring out what was that was a hell of a series that's probably one of my favorites my rear end man i have to tell you psychologically you know just you know when you get to these i think i'm guessing here i think it's 26 hours all pieces together think about and and we don't do scripts it's improvised yeah so think about what 20 20 i had somebody write on twitter just yesterday saying um he said something like i'm not seeing the dedication here you're only getting 2.5 shows out a year and i wanted to say man you have no idea what the only people who understand really are other history podcasters and even they don't generally do 26 hours you know that was a two-year endeavor um as i said the first show we ever did was like 15 minutes i could crank out one of those a month but when you're doing i mean the last show we did on the fall of the roman republic was five and a half hours that's a book right um and it was part six or something so i mean you just do the math um and it felt like you were excited to interrupt and on world war one it felt like you were emotionally pulled in to it like it felt taxing i was gonna say if that's a good thing though because that you know and i think we said during the show that was the feeling that the people at the time have and i think at one point we said if this is starting to seem gruesomely repetitive now you know how the people at the time felt so in other words that had any sort of inadvertently because when you improvise the show some of these things are inadvertent but it had inadvertently created the right climate for having a sense of empathy with the storyline and to me that those are the serendipitous moments that make this art and not uh some sort of paint by the numbers kind of endeavor you know and and that's to me that wouldn't have happened had we scripted it out so it's mostly you just bring the tools of knowledge to the table and then in large part improvise like the actual wording i always say we make it like they made things like spinal tap and some of those other things where um the material so so i do have notes about things like on page 427 of this book you have this quote so that i know aha i'm at the point where i can drop that in um and sometimes i'll write notes saying here's where you left off yesterday so i remember um but in the improvisation you end up throwing a lot out and so um like like but it allows us to go off on tangents like we'll try things like i'll sit there and go i wonder what this would sound like and i'll spend two days going down that road and then i'll listen to him and go it doesn't work but that's you know like writers do this all the time it's called killing your babies right you got can't you know get not but people go so this guy goes i'm not seeing the dedication he has no idea how many things were thrown out i did an hour and a half i had an hour and a half into the current show about two months ago and i listened to it and i just went you know what it's not right boom out the window there goes six weeks of work yeah right but here's the problem you trust you're sorry to interrupt do you trust your judgment on that no no uh but but here's here's the here's the thing um our show is a little different than other people's uh joe rogan called it evergreen content in other words uh my political show is like a car you buy and the minute you drive it off the lot it loses half its value right because it's not current anymore these shows are just as good or just as bad uh five years from now as they are when we do although the standards on the internet change so when i listen to my old shows i cringe sometimes because the standards are so much higher now but when you're creating evergreen content you have two audiences to worry about you have the audience that's waiting for the next show and they've already heard the other ones and they're impatient and they're telling you on twitter where is it but you have show the show's also for people five years from now who haven't discovered it yet and who don't care a wit for how long it took because they're going to be able to download the whole and all they care about is quality and so what i always tell new podcasters is they always say i read all these things it's very important you have a release schedule well it's not more important than putting out a good piece of work and the audience will forgive me if it takes too long but it's really good when you get it they will not forgive me if i rush it to get it out on time and it's a piece of crap so for us and this is why when you brought up a spotify deal or anything else they can't interfere with this at all because my my job here as far as i'm concerned is quality and everything else goes by the wayside because the only thing people care about long term the only thing that gives you longevity is how good is it right how good is that book if you read jrr tolkien's work tomorrow you don't care how long it took him to write it all he cares how good is this today and that's what we try to think too and i feel like if it's good if it's really good everything else falls into place and takes care of itself um and although sometimes to push back sorry to interrupt i've done it to you a thousand times so you can get me back please sometimes the deadline you know some of the greatest like movies and books have been you think about like dostoyevsky i forget which one knows from underground or something he needed the money so he had to write it real quick sometimes the deadline creates is powerful at taking a creative mind of an artist and just like slapping it around to force some of the good stuff out now the problem with history of course is there's there's different definitions of good um that like it's not just about what you talk about which is the storytelling the richness of the storytelling and i'm sure you're you know again not to compliment you too much but you're one of the great storytellers of our time that that i'm sure if you put in a jail cell and force a like somebody point a gun at you you could tell one hell of a good story but you still need the facts of history uh or not necessarily the facts but you know like making sure you painting the right full picture not perfectly right that's what i meant about the audience doesn't understand what a history podcast is you can't just riff and be wrong so so let me let me both both oppose what you just said and back up what you just said excellent so i have a book that i wrote right and uh and in a book you have a hard deadline right so harpercollins had a hard deadline on that book so when i released it i was mad because i would have worked on it a lot longer which is my style right get it right but we had a chapter in that book entitled pandemic prologue question mark and it was the book about the the part about the black death and the 1918 flu and all that kind of stuff and and i was just doing an interview with a spanish journalist this morning who said did you ever think how lucky you got on that on that you know and first of all lucky on a pandemic it strikes you but had i had my druthers i would have kept that book working in my study for months more and the pandemic would have happened yes and that epis that would have looked like a chapter i wrote after the fact i would have to rewrite the whole thing it would have been so that argues for for what you said at the same time i i would have spent months more working on it because to me it didn't look the way i wanted it to look yet you know can you drop a hint of the things that you're keeping on the shelves oh the alexander the great podcast i've talked around the very i i talked to somebody the other day said do you know that the very first word in your very first podcast in the title the very first thing that anybody ever saw with hardcore history is that is the word alexander and because the show's entitled alexander versus hitler i have talked around the career i've done show after i talked about his mother in one episode i talked about the the the funeral games after his death i've talked around this i've specifically left this giant alexandrian-sized hole in the middle because we're going to do that show one day and i'm going to lovingly enjoy talking about this crazily interesting figure of alexander the great so that's one of the ones that's on the back pocket list and what we try to do is is um whenever this we're doing um second world war in asia and the pacific now i'm on part five whenever the heck we finish this the tendency is to then pick a very different period because we've had it and the audience has had it um so it's time so um i will eventually get to the alexander saga what about just one last kind of little part of this is uh what about the other half of that first 10-minute 15-minute episode which is so you've done quite a bit about the world war you've done quite a bit about germany will you ever think about doing hitler the man it's funny because uh i talked earlier about how i don't like to go back to the old shows because our standards have changed so much well a long time ago one of my standards for not getting five hour podcasts done or or not getting too deeply into them was to flit around the interesting points we didn't realize we were going to get an audience that wanted the actual history we thought we could just go with assume the audience knew the details and just talk about the weird stuff that only makes up one part of the show now so we did a show called nazi tidbits and it was just little things about you know it's totally out of date now like you know you can still buy them but they're out of date um where we dealt a little with it uh you know it would be interesting but i'll give you another example i mean history is not stagnant as you know uh and we had talked about stalin earlier and uh ghost of the offspring was done years ago and people will write me from russia now and say well your portrayal of stalin is totally out of uh out of uh uh it's it's outdated because there's all this new stuff from the former soviet union and you do you turn around and you go okay um they're right and so when you talk about hitler it's very interesting to think about how i would do a hitler show today versus how i did one 10 years ago um and you would think well what's new i mean it happened so long but there's lots of new stuff and there's lots of new scholarship and and so um yeah i would think that would be an interesting one to do someday uh i i haven't thought about that that's not in the back pocket but uh but yeah that'd be interesting i have a disproportionate amount of power because i trapped you somehow in the room and and thereby during a pandemic so like my hope will be stuck in your head but after alexander the great which would be an amazing uh podcast i i hope you do cons give a return to hitler the rise and fall of the third reich which to me uh i i have a contemporary book basically yeah yeah and i exactly it's by a person who was there shira yeah i i really loved that study of the man of hitler and i would love to hear your study of certain aspects of it perhaps even an episode that's like more focused on a very particular period i just feel like you can uh tell a story that it's funny hitler is one of the most studied people and i still feel like this all the stories or most of the stories haven't been told oh and there's listen i've got three books at home i'm on all the publishers lists now and they just young hitler there's this hitler there's that i mean i've been reading these books and i've read about hitler i read the rise and fall of the third reich my mother thought i needed to go to a psychologist because i read it when i was six and she said there's something wrong with the boy and but but um but she was right but she was absolutely right but uh but you would think that that something like that is pretty established fact and yet there's new stuff coming out all the time and needless to say uh germany's been investigating this guy forever and sometimes it takes years to get the translations i took five years of german in school i can't read any of it so um so i mean and and he is when you talk about fascinating figures he's so the whole thing is so twistedly weird um there was a it came out a couple years ago somebody found a tape of him talking to uh gender i want to say it was general um uh the finnish general manaheim right um and and he's just in a very normal conversation of the sort we're having now and you know the hitler tapes when you hear normally he's ranting and raving but this was a very sedate and i wish i'd understood the german well enough to really get a feel because i was reading uh what germans said they said wow you can really hear the southern accent you know little things that only a a native speaker would hear and i remember thinking this is such a different side of this twisted character and you would think you would always you would think that this was information that was out in in in in the rise and fall of the third ranking but it wasn't and so this this this is uh goes along with that stuff about new stuff coming out all the time alexander new stuff coming out all the time really well at least interpretations rather than factual data and those color your those give depth to your understanding yes you and you want that because the historiography people people love that and that was a byproduct of my lack of credentials where we thought we're going to bring in um the historians we call them audio footnotes right a way for me to say listen i'm not a historian but i'll quote this guy who is so you can trust him but then we would quote other people who had different views and people didn't realize that that you know if they're not history majors that historians don't always agree on this stuff and that they have disagreements and they loved that so so i i love the fact that there's more stuff out there because it allows us to then bring in um other points of view and sort of maybe three-dimensionalize or flesh out the story a little bit more two last questions one really simple one absurdly ridiculous and perhaps also simple first who is ben and is he real i don't even know what you're talking about very well how's that for an answer it's like asking me is harvey the white rabbit reel i don't know there's carrots all around the production room but i don't know what that means well a lot of people demanded that i prove i somehow figure out a way to prove the existence if i said he was real people would say no he's not and if i said he was if he wasn't real they would say yes he is so it's a santa claus easter bunny kind of vibe there yeah i mean what is real anyway that's exactly what i told him if it exists okay the most absurd question i'm very sorry very excited but then again i'm not what what's the meaning of it all you you study history of human history have you been able to make sense of why the hell we're here on this spinning rock does any of it even make sense what's the meaning of life what i look at sometimes that i find interesting is certain consistencies that we have over time uh history doesn't repeat but it has a a constant and the constant is us now we change i mentioned earlier the the wickedly weird time we live in with what social media is doing to us as guinea pigs and that's a new element but we're still people who are motivated by love hate greed envy sex i mean all these things that would have connected us with the ancients right that's the part that always makes history sound like it rhymes you know and when you put the constant the human element and you mix it with systems that are similar so one of the reasons that the ancient roman republic is something that people point to all the time um as a as something that seems like we're repeating history is because you have the two con you have humans just like you had then and you have a system that resembles the one we have here so you throw the constant in with a system that is somewhat similar and you begin to see things that look like they rhyme a little um so for me i'm always trying to figure out more about us and when you show us in uh 500 years ago in asia and 800 years ago in africa and you look at all these different places that you put the guinea pig in and you watch how the guinea pig responds to the different stimuli and challenges i feel like it helps me flesh out a little bit more who we are in the long timeline not who we are today specifically but who we've always been um it's a personal quest it's not meant to educate anybody else it's it's something that fascinates me do you think there's uh in that common humanity throughout history the of the guinea pig is there a why underneath it all or is it somehow like it feels like it's an experiment of some sort oh now you're into elon musk and i talked about this the simulation thing right nick bostrom's sure yeah the idea that there's some some kid and we're the equivalent of an alien's ant farm you know and we hope he doesn't throw a tarantula in just to see what happens um i think the whys elude us and i think that what makes philosophy and religion and those sorts of things so interesting is that they grapple with the whys um but i'm not wise enough to to uh propose a theory myself but i'm interested enough to read all the other ones out there so um i i let's put it this way i don't think there's any definitive why that's been agreed upon but the various theories are fascinating yeah whatever it is whoever the kid is that created this thing the the ant farm kind of interesting it's so far a little bit a little bit twisted and perverted and sadistic that's what makes it fun i think um but then again that's the russian perspective i was just gonna say it is the russian perspective a little bit of what makes the russians so russian history one day i'll do some russian history i took it to college that's the ant farm baby that's an ant farm with a very very frustrated young uh uh teenage alien kid dan i can't say i've already complimented you way too much i'm a huge fan this has been an incredible conversation it's a huge gift i your your gift of humanity i hope you let me cut you off and just say you've done a wonderful job this has been fun for me the questions and more importantly the questions can come from anybody the counter statements your responses have been wonderful you made this a very fun intellectual discussion for me thank you well let me have the last word and say i agree with elon and despite the doom caster say that i think we've concluded definitively and you don't get a chance to respond that love is in fact the answer and

以下是與硬核歷史和常識播客主持人丹-卡林的對話，對我來說，硬核歷史是有史以來最偉大的播客之一，丹和喬-羅根可能是讓我愛上播客這個媒介的兩個主要人物，作爲一個粉絲，最終作爲一個播客自己遇到丹是超現實的，他不只是一個像我們其他人一樣的普通人，因爲他的聲音一直是通過一些指導 對我來說，見到他就像在俄勒岡州中部的一個蹩腳的酒店房間裏見到成吉思汗、斯大林、希特勒、亞歷山大大帝和歷史上所有最強大的領導人一樣，事實證明，他實際上只是一個人，而且是真正的好人之一，這對我來說是一種樂趣和榮譽。 在 第二是simplisafe，這是一家家庭安全公司，我用來監控和保護我的公寓。對我來說，出路在於理性和愛，這兩者都需要對人性和人類歷史有深刻的理解，這次談話就是關於這兩方面的。 我對我們的未來也許是無望的樂觀，但如果我們真的站在大過濾器的懸崖邊上，看着我們的世界被火吞噬，那就把這個小小的播客談話當作啓示錄前最後一餐的開胃菜，如果你喜歡這個東西，在YouTube上訂閱，評論五星，Nappa播客在Spotify上關注支持 現在，最後是我與偉大的丹-卡林的對話，讓我們從最高的哲學問題開始，你認爲人類從根本上是好的，還是我們所有人都有能力既做好事又做壞事，是環境塑造了我們，呃，我們在生活中的軌跡，我們如何定義邪惡，邪惡似乎是一個情景的眼睛的那種問題，所以如果我們定義邪惡，也許我可以得到一個更好的想法和 這可能是一個完整的節目，但當我們說邪惡的時候，我們的意思是什麼？ 這是一個難以把握的問題，但我認爲在某種程度上，你的存在，你在這個世界上的存在導致了世界上其他許多人的痛苦和破壞，所以你偷走了資源，你用它們來創造比以前更多的痛苦，所以我想這與另一個難以把握的詞有很大的關係，那就是痛苦，因爲你在世界上創造痛苦 你給世界帶來了痛苦，但問題是，我認爲，因爲我 我完全明白你的意思，我也理解 問題是造成痛苦的原因問題 所以有時候，一個人可能對一羣人造成痛苦，以便最大限度地減少另一羣人的痛苦 或者一個可能根本不被認爲是邪惡的人可能做出看似合理的選擇，對一小部分人造成痛苦和折磨 爲了讓更多的人享受到與之相反的待遇 這也是我認爲最黑暗的事情之一 我說過也讀過Stephen Codkin的作品 我不知道你是否熟悉這位歷史學家 他基本上是一位斯大林學者 約瑟夫-斯大林學者 我意識到一件事 我不知道該把希特勒放在哪裏 但對於斯大林來說 他真的很理智 他認爲自己在爲世界做貢獻 他 我真的相信從我讀到的關於斯大林的一切中 他認爲 共產主義對世界是有益的，如果你不得不沿途殺死一些人，如果是像你說的那些小團體，如果你不得不清除那些阻礙這個共產主義烏托邦系統的人，那麼這實際上對世界是有益的，在我看來，他甚至不能考慮他是邪惡的可能性，他真的認爲他在爲世界做善事，這讓我印象深刻，因爲他是最符合我們邪惡定義的人之一。他給這個世界帶來的邪惡比歷史上任何一個人都要多 我不知道該怎麼做 我對這個概念非常着迷，以至於我們做的第一個鐵桿歷史節目，足足有15或16分鐘 嗯，叫做亞歷山大與希特勒的對決 整個問題就是動機，對吧 如果你去法院，因爲你殺了人 他們要考慮的事情之一就是你爲什麼要殺他們，對吧 在節目中，我們想知道，因爲你知道我並沒有真正地發表意見，但我們想知道，如果你相信希特勒的著作，例如《我的奮鬥》，你知道這是一個人寫的，他是一個政治人物，他想得到。我的意思是，它和其他政治文章一樣可信 但在他的腦海中，他說他要做的事是爲了改善德國人民的生活 而亞歷山大大帝則是2000多年前的人，所以有很多宣傳 但亞歷山大大帝的觀點之一是 他之所以這麼做是爲了在歷史上留下更多的塗鴉 換句話說，是爲了榮耀自己 如果是這樣的話，亞歷山大是不是比希特勒更壞呢？因爲希特勒認爲他是在做好事，而亞歷山大 如果你相信這個解釋，他只是想抬高亞歷山大 所以做這些事的人的動機在我看來很重要 我不認爲你可以坐在那裏，說唯一重要的是最終的結果 因爲那可能是無意的副產品 因爲那可能是無意的副產品 在這種情況下，如果你能向他們展示未來 可能就會改變他們的所作所爲 那麼他們是邪惡的還是被誤導的 還是錯誤的，還是做錯的？同時，如果你對邪惡的概念很着迷，並且深入研究的話 你就會想了解爲什麼這些邪惡的人做了那些事 有時候會讓你很困惑 誰會想坐在那裏，從希特勒的角度去看問題 來獲得更好的理解和同情呢 但事實上，第一個歷史節目，我對這個概念很着迷 你認爲是否有可能，如果我們把自己放在一些人的心態上，這些人在世界範圍內創造瞭如此多的痛苦，他們都有自己的動機，都有良好的意圖，我不認爲，我的意思是，僅僅是因爲有這麼多的人，我的意思是，平均法 我的意思是，平均法則表明這不是真的 我想這是純邪惡的可能，也就是說，你... ...這是很難以把握的，但你的目標是苦難，是有意的苦難 是的，我認爲，我認爲有一些歷史人物，人們可以指出，但這涉及到更深的問題，這些人是 他們是不是有什麼問題？ 他們是不是在年輕時被扭曲了？ 你知道，我的意思是，這些都是你開始深入研究這些人的心理構成的事情。 換句話說，是否有人生來就是邪惡的，我實際上相信有些人是。我認爲邪惡的問題也很重要 因爲我認爲這是一個看人的問題 我的意思是，如果希特勒成功了 我們今天是第三帝國的第六或第七位領導人 因爲我認爲他的整個歷史會通過不同的視角來看待 對蒙古人來說是不同的，對巴格達的居民來說是不同的，我想，所以一個看問題的人的眼睛，我認爲進入所有這些事情，正如你所說的，這是一個非常難以把握的問題，你把作爲一個對軍事歷史着迷的人，你把暴力放在哪裏，因爲呃，在人類的條件方面 它是人類的核心還是隻是我們偶爾使用的一個小工具 所以我想用一個問題來回答你的問題 你認爲暴力和武力的區別是什麼 讓我說遠一點 我不確定暴力是我們人類必須永遠忍受的東西 我們必須永遠忍受暴力 但我更難看到我們能夠廢除武力 如果這兩件事不一樣，我不知道它們是否相同 肯定會有一些交叉點 我認爲這是一個物理定律 如果你不能阻止某樣東西向某個方向移動 而不向那個方向反擊的話 我不確定你能有一個社會或文明 如果沒有能力在事情發生時使用反擊力量的話 一個人攻擊另一個人，你就會介入去救那個人 或者是在最高級別的政治或其他事情上 用反作用力去阻止另一個運動的慣性或動力 所以我認爲力量是人類互動中一個簡單的幾乎是物理學的規律 特別是在文明的層面上 我認爲文明需要一定量的暴力，而不是武力 所以，他們又一次談到了 我的意思是，這可以追溯到聖奧古斯丁的各種基督教信仰 關於武力的正確使用，人們在哲學上試圖決定 你能不能有一種Ahinsa 呃 佛教的那種，我們 你知道我們將是非 對任何事物都不使用暴力
我認爲武力是不可避免的，現在我們可以談談，我自己還沒有得出結論 如果在武力和暴力之間有區別的話，我的意思是... 我的意思是，非暴力的力量是否足夠，或者說，當暴力是出於善的原因時，與暴力是不同的，或者說是出於邪惡的原因，或者僅僅是出於隨機的原因，我的意思是，我們人類缺乏控制力，有時我們可以沒有明顯的理由或目標而採取暴力行動，這是我的意思，你看一下刑事司法系統，以及我們與那些以我們作爲一個社會決定是不可容忍的方式行事的人互動的方式，你能在沒有武力和某種程度的暴力情況下處理這些問題嗎，我不知道你能在沒有武力情況下保持和平，我不知道只是爲了 呃，有點 關於武力的概念，你是否認爲武力是足夠普遍的，可以將武力納入思想的空間，所以你提到了佛教或宗教，或者只是微博，我想沒有比這更遙遠的事情了，好吧，我們在思想的空間裏做的戰鬥，嗯，你知道整個歷史的大辯論 歷史上，你是把武力放在其中，還是在這次談話中，我們現在只想把它保持在肉體的力量上，說到這裏，你有一種直覺，武力可能比暴力更長久地伴隨着我們，我想這兩者是相通的，所以，嗯，因爲它一直是，一直是我去... 我相信聽衆們都不喜歡這個例子，但就拿德國來說吧，在納粹上臺前的1920年代初，他們總是參與某種程度的武力，你知道在街上打人或什麼的，但想一想，這更像是一場知識分子的討論，直到某一點，我想很難讓知識分子的反力量 如果我們想用我們剛纔說的短語的話，我想這兩者是密切相關的，我的意思是，行動是跟隨思想的，而在某一點上，我想特別是當一個人沒有達到他們想通過和平討論或論證或試圖說服對方來實現的目標的時候 當一個人通過和平的討論或爭論，或者試圖說服另一方時，有時下一層次的行動是更實際的東西，如果這有意義的話，我們從智力到身體，所以它很容易蔓延到暴力，是的，一個經常導致另一個，所以你有點暗示，也許是一個希望的信息，但讓我以問題的形式問，你認爲我們會一直有戰爭嗎，我認爲這涉及到力量 比如說，你會怎麼做？ 我是說，我們現在就來玩玩民族國家，雖然我不知道民族國家是什麼，我們應該把它當作永久的憲法來看待，但一個民族國家應該如何阻止另一個民族國家的行爲，讓它認爲是不利於全球社會或者不利於自己民族的利益？ 你知道，我認爲我們已經有了這個問題，可以追溯到古代，但在20世紀，這個問題已經出現了很多 我的意思是，整個第二次世界大戰的爭論有時是圍繞着適當的反擊力量的想法 你可以創建一個實體，一個國家聯盟，一個聯合國，一個世界實體，也許甚至可以減輕反擊力量的需要，包括 大規模的暴力、軍隊、海軍和那些東西 我想這是一個公開的討論，我們仍在進行中 思考這個問題是很好的，因爲 嗯，我們像一個聯合的國家 通常有一個集中的控制 所以有人類在頂部 有委員會，嗯，通常像領導人出現 一個單一的數字，然後可以成爲 腐敗的權力，這只是一個非常重要的 這是一個非常重要的實驗，也是一個需要嚴格思考的問題 如何構建足夠穩定的政府體系，以推動我們減少戰爭，減少不穩定，減少另一場不公平的武力應用的戰爭 你知道，這確實是一個核心問題，我們正在努力弄清楚，作爲人類，我們的武器越來越好，越來越好，越來越好地摧毀自己，感覺這很重要 思考如何減少過度使用或不公平使用武力是很重要的 你和我都是在很高的智力水平上討論這個問題，但也有一個尾巴搖動的因素 所以想想一個戰士的社會，一個很久以前的部落社會 你的社會里有戰士，他們存在的理由有多少？他們引以爲豪的是什麼？ 他們爲之訓練的是什麼？ 他們在自己的文明中的地位是什麼？ 這本身在多大程度上推動了社會的反應？ 你需要戰爭來使戰士合法化？ 你知道這是一個古老的論點，你得到的，我們在20世紀也有這樣的論點，即武器和軍隊的建立創造了使用它們的動機，對嗎？激勵是他們存在的理由 這就是我們開始討論所有這些不同的社會元素相互作用的地方 所以當我們討論政府和戰爭的時候 我們需要考慮到這些政府爲了保護自己而建立的各種制度和軍隊，以及類似的事情 但他們對你的選擇範圍有影響，不是嗎？ 你讓我意識到，在我的成長過程中 我覺得我把很多戰士都當成了英雄 對我來說，我不知道這種感覺從何而來 但在戰鬥中死去是一種光榮的死法 我試圖在不同的層面上進行區分 所以在基礎層面上，那些在前線做戰鬥的人 對我來說，那些人可以和警察、消防員和人們相提並論 消防員 嗯，但我的意思是那些參與道德的人 嗯，試圖執行一項任務，最終 嗯，人們可以看到在許多情況下是一種節約的任務 對，或者如果沒有其他原因，是一個自我 爲了他們所看到的更大的利益而做出的犧牲，現在我把個人和他們是軍隊的一部分的實體區分開來，我當然也把軍隊和整個缺乏一個更好的詞的軍事工業綜合體區分開來。 我對那些上層人士的道德歸屬感比對地面上的人要少得多 地面上的人可能是我們中的任何一個人，而且已經在很多情況下 你知道我們現在有一個非常專業的軍隊，它是人口的一個分支，但在其他時期，我們有徵兵和徵兵，它不是人口的一個分支，它是 我把那些戰士和那些實體區分開來 他們是軍隊的一部分 或者是在最高政治層面控制軍隊的人 我對他們的道德感降低了很多 我不認爲軍隊本身是英雄，我也不認爲軍事工業綜合體是英雄 我認爲這是一個搖尾乞憐的情況 我認爲這吸引了我們把軍事努力看作是解決問題的方法，比我們本來的想法要快得多 說實話，把這一切聯繫起來，我實際上是把這些受害者看作是我們所談論的士兵 我的意思是，如果你 如果你設置了一個火派消防員進入戰鬥 嗯，我覺得不好的消防員 我覺得你已經濫用的信任 你給那些人吧 所以，當人們談論戰爭 我總是認爲，人 我們必須確保 戰爭是真正必要的 嗯，爲了保護是人 爲了保護這些人 你要派他們去打仗 我們社會中最大的受害者往往是戰士 所以我認爲 當我們看到這些人從伊拉克這樣的地方回家時 我知道他們不願意這樣想 因爲這完全違背了他們的精神 但如果你派人去保護這個國家的海岸 那就是英雄 如果你派人去做一些他們本來不需要做的事 但他們是出於政治原因或其他任何你想說的原因 或者其他與國防無關的原因 那麼你就成了我們英雄的犧牲品 所以我覺得我們經常談論我們的軍隊和士兵之類的東西 但我們並沒有把他們當做有價值的人，就像言論中說的那樣，否則我們會更加 如果你要把我的兒子送去 我沒有兒子，我有女兒 但如果你要把我的兒子送到危險的地方 我就會要求你真的需要把他送到危險的地方 如果你把他送到危險的地方，我就會對你很生氣 如果他不這樣做，如果沒有必要這樣做，所以我有更多的懷疑 所以我對這個系統有更多的懷疑，它把這些人派到這些情況下，他們被要求成爲英雄，而不是我在地面上的人，我把他們看成是 呃，要麼是保衛我們的人，你知道在這樣的情況下，你知道第二次世界大戰的例子，或者是人，嗯變成是 或者是一個系統的受害者 他們只是一個齒輪和機器 機器並不真正關心他們 就像言論和宣傳所暗示的那樣 是的，就像我自己的家庭歷史一樣 如果我們能討論一下就好了 在你所說的地方有一個灰色地帶
什麼都有灰色地帶 但如果這個灰色地帶是你自己血脈的一部分 對我來說是值得一說的 給我舉個例子吧 你做了一個四集的《美國前線的幽靈》節目 是的 我出生在蘇聯 我在莫斯科長大 我爸爸在基輔出生和長大 我奶奶最近剛去世 她在烏克蘭長大 她是俄羅斯和烏克蘭邊境的一個小城市 在基輔，有趣的是，一切的時間安排，因爲你可能會聯繫到她倖存下來，她是我一生中遇到的最壞的女人，我所攜帶的大部分戰士精神可能是來自於她，她在30年代烏克蘭的飢餓中倖存下來，她是一個美麗的少女，在納粹佔領期間，所以她倖存了所有這些，當然，家庭，每個人，你知道，許多人在整個過程中死亡，所以，其中一件事。你在節目中談到的灰色地帶就是即使是戰士，他們也是如此，就像你現在說的那樣，他們沒有選擇，所以我的祖父在另一邊，他是一個機槍手，在烏克蘭，在紅軍，在紅軍 是的，他們通過呃，像這樣的聲明，我不知道是否明顯，但規則是沒有投降，所以你最好死，所以你 我是說你的目標基本上是當 他在戰鬥中很幸運，是唯一因受傷而存活下來的人 當時納粹正向莫斯科進軍 在烏克蘭的整個目標是拖住每一個人 讓他們進入冬天 我是說，我把他看作是一個英雄 他相信他是無堅不摧的，這是倖存者的偏見 你知道子彈無法傷害他，這就是每個人的信念 當然，基本上每個人都是這樣 他很快就升到了軍銜，這樣說吧 因爲每個人都死了 都是拖着重機槍的屍體 你知道我一直在慢慢地撤退 射擊和撤退 射擊和撤退 我不知道他對我來說是個英雄 我一直認爲他是打敗納粹的人 對嗎？像棋子一樣被用來下棋 所以有一種說法是他是受害者，就像你描述的那樣 然後不知爲什麼，這種說法更讓人麻痹，更讓人覺得 我不知道，把他想成是英雄，把他想成是俄羅斯 蘇聯拯救了世界，感覺更好 我的意思是，這種說法在美國也有，美國是把世界從納粹手中拯救出來的關鍵 感覺這種說法對人們很有力量，我不確定，我也帶着它 但當我思考如何正確看待那場戰爭時 我不確定這是否是正確的說法 讓我給你一些建議 有一句話是一個叫Eugene Sledge的海軍陸戰隊員曾經說過的 我把它放在我的手機上 因爲它是一個真正的區別 他說前線纔是真正的戰爭所在 任何人即使在前線一百碼的地方 也不知道它到底是什麼樣子的 現在的區別是有很多人在前線幾英里之外 你可以在後方的醫療單位，炮兵可以攻擊你，飛機可以啓動，我的意思是你可能處於危險之中，但在前線有兩種不同的情況，一種是，至少，我現在做了很多關於這個的閱讀，讀了很多老兵的敘述，詹姆斯-瓊斯寫了呃呃書，比如從這裏到永恆的第二次世界大戰的虛構敘述，但他是基於自己的服務，比如1942年在瓜達爾卡納爾島。瓊斯說，一個士兵在前線行動中的演變需要一個幾乎投降的想法，你會活下去，你你會習慣於你會死的想法，他說你是一個不同的人，只是因爲認真考慮這個想法，因爲我們大多數人沒有，但這讓你做的是在前線做那個工作，如果 如果你太在意自己的生命 你就會變成一個不擅長工作的人 另一件事是在前線100碼的人做的，而在後方醫療單位的人不做，那就是你殺人，你殺了很多人，你不只是哦，後面有一個狙擊手，所以我打了他 我們從一個位置到另一個位置，我們殺了很多人，這些事情會改變你。這些事情會改變你，而這往往不是普遍的，因爲我讀過紅軍士兵的敘述，他們非常愛國，對嗎？ 但很多愛國主義是多年後作爲懷舊和記憶的一部分，當你在前線100碼的地方，往往被歸結爲一個非常小的世界，所以你的祖父是你的祖父，祖父在機槍旁。他關心的是他的位置和他的戰友，以及那些他有責任的人，在這一點上，這是一個非常小的世界，對我來說，這就是英雄主義的所在，他不是在爲一些巨大的世界文明而戰，他是在爲拯救他身邊的人和他自己的生命而戰，因爲他們也在拯救他，這有很大的 這就涉及到我們之前關於武力的問題 你爲什麼要使用武力呢？ 不如說是爲了保護我兩邊的人吧，他們的生命 現在是否有仇恨？他說你爲什麼一直叫他們納粹 他說說他們是什麼人 他們是德國人 這個人希望我不要爲德國開脫 說是這羣可怕的人佔領了你們的國家 他說德國人做了這些 他說我們不要忘記他們對我們做了什麼 以及爲什麼我們不得不做的事 所以對我來說，當我們談論這些戰鬥情況時，我稱這些人爲英雄的原因是他們在爲捍衛我們都能理解的東西而戰鬥 我是說如果你來找我的兄弟，我拿着機槍向你射擊，你就會超過我，我是說你會，但這就變成了一種情況，我們之前談到的反擊力量 嗯，當你在救人或者你在救你身後的這個小鎮時，稱自己爲英雄要容易得多 在你身後的這個鎮子裏 如果他們打穿了你的機槍 他們就會燒掉這些村子 把這些人扔在冬天裏 這些家庭對我來說是一種非常不同的英雄主義 而不是這種無定形的愛國主義 你知道愛國主義是一個我們經常使用的東西 是的，人們通過對國家的愛來操縱我們 因爲他們知道我們對此有強烈的感受 但他們有時會利用這一點來對付我們 以掀起戰爭的熱潮或吸引人們 我是說有一句很好的臺詞，我希望我能完整地記住它 赫爾曼-戈林曾說過，讓人民參與戰爭是多麼容易 他說，你知道你只是在呼籲他們的愛國主義 我是說有一些按鈕，你可以按下 我是說有一些按鈕，你可以利用這些東西，比如說愛國，以及我們對那些把自己的生命置之度外的戰士的忠誠和欽佩 這些都是人類可以操縱的東西，可以可靠地讓我們朝着一個更清醒的反思狀態下的方向發展，我們會考慮不同的方向。人們揮舞着旗幟，開始譴責敵人，開始簽名 你知道，我們在古代已經看到過一次又一次這樣的情況 但對國家的愛也是很美好的，所以我在美國沒有看到過這樣的情況 美國人愛他們的國家，愛國主義在美國很強，但沒有我記憶中那麼強，即使是在我年輕的時候 年輕時對蘇聯的熱愛 現在是蘇聯嗎？ 這需要區分，還是俄羅斯母親？ 它實際上是共產黨 好吧，它是這個系統的存在 好吧，這個系統的存在，就像愛 我還沒有很深入的心理研究，你到底愛什麼？讓我來做個比較吧 我經常說，美國和蘇聯一樣 是一個以意識形態爲基礎的社會 對，所以你拿法國這樣的國家來說 不管你在哪個法國政府，法國人都已經是法國人了 對，它不是以意識形態爲基礎的 對，而把美國團結起來的是一個意識形態 自由，自由 憲法，這就是吸引你的地方 你知道，這就是 "多元一體 "的思想 對，這就是 "多元一體 "的思想 是什麼把所有這些獨特的不同的人聯繫在一起的呢？如果你相信斯大林的言論，有一天大家都會團結在這個意識形態的旗幟下 對，這是一場全球革命 所以意識形態社會是不同的，要成爲一個意識形態框架和目標的粉絲 我是說我是一個自由的人，對嗎？ 我希望看到世界上每個人都有我的政府系統，這是一個偏見的一部分 對，因爲他們可能不希望這樣，但我認爲這對每個人都更好，因爲我 但我認爲這對所有人都好 因爲我認爲這對我來說更好 如果你考慮到意識形態 你知道這源於啓蒙運動的思想 有一種偏見 所以我的偏見是對的 但你覺得這就是爲什麼你說 我們要把自由帶到伊拉克 我們要把自由帶到這裏 我們要把自由帶到這裏 因爲我們認爲我們向你們傳播的東西 是不可否認的積極的
我們要給你們自由，給你們這個... ...我很難抹去自己的偏見，因爲如果我在伊拉克，我會想要自由... ...但如果你離開，讓伊拉克人投票給他們想要的人... ...他們會不會投票給某人... ...你知道你現在看俄羅斯，我經常聽到俄羅斯人的聲音，因爲我對俄羅斯和蘇聯的很多看法是在我成長的年代形成的，而你 你知道，當時我們沒有聽到很多蘇聯人的意見，但現在你聽到了，今天你聽到的俄羅斯人會說，你對斯大林的看法是過時的、冷酷的，你知道，所以你試圖重新調整你的信仰，但這是一個想法，如果你給俄羅斯人民一個自由和公平的投票，他們會投票給那些承諾給他們一個基於啓蒙民主原則的自由和開放社會的人，或者他們會投票給我們美國的人。 他們會把票投給我們美國的人嗎？ 他們會把票投給某個強人，他只是個好人，所以... ...我認爲要拋棄我們自己的偏見和成見是非常困難的，你知道這是個見仁見智的事情，但是當你在談論意識形態社會的時候，要拋棄所有多年來灌輸給你的體系的東西是非常困難的。聽着，在蘇聯，馬克思主義是每個教室的一部分 你知道，你可能在學習幾何學，他們會把馬克思主義放在裏面，因爲那是團結社會的東西，那是給它一個更高的目標，那是使它在人們心中成爲它的捍衛者的東西。我們在這裏也是這樣做的，事實上大多數人都是這樣做的，但無論意識形態或政府是什麼，你仍然是法國人，所以從這個意義上說，這兩種制度的冷戰是很有趣的，因爲它們都是基於意識形態的制度，涉及許多不同背景的人，他們都是在這個制度的保護傘下團結起來的。團結在意識形態的保護傘下 首先，這句話說得很好 我處於一個有趣的位置，在我成長的歲月裏，我13歲來到這裏，當我 你知道青少年是你的初戀或其他，因爲我愛上了美國的自由和個人的想法，但我也記得，就像你記得的那樣，也許是一個前 我還記得作爲一個非常不同的人，我愛上了蘇聯的想法，比如我們有國歌，這仍然是我認爲最糟糕的國歌，這是蘇聯的國歌，比如說我們是堅不可摧的國家 我的意思是，這些話是這樣的，比如美國人的話是這樣的，我們很好，我們是自由的，但是像俄羅斯的蘇聯的國歌是這樣的，我們很壞 [__] 沒有人會摧毀我們 呃，我只記得作爲一個孩子對一個國家感到自豪，像啞巴一樣，不知道 因爲我們都要背誦這些東西 嗯，一切都很統一，一切都很自豪 我沒想過官僚主義的破壞性，無能，你知道的，所有的東西都是隨着共產主義的實施而來的，特別是在80年代和90年代，但我記得喜歡那套思想的感覺，所以我在一個有趣的地方，記得像換了一個愛，因爲我是你知道的，我有點開玩笑，是俄羅斯人，但你知道我的長期 但我的長期一夫一妻制的關係並不是與美國的理想相聯繫的，就像我被困在我的腦海裏一樣，但我記得愛它的感覺，我，我也想過這個問題，當人們批評中國或他們批評目前的狀況時，斯大林是如何被記住的，普京是如何被記住的。你不能總是把美國的個人主義和自由的理想穿在身上，去分析其他地方的世界觀，比如中國和俄羅斯，如果你不像美國人那樣把自己看得太重，就像我一樣，這是對自己的一種美麗的愛。對政府的信任是一種美麗的愛 放棄自己的權利和自由 相信比自己更大的東西 這實際上是一種自由 你實際上是在解放自己 你就把自己的權力交給了世界的流動，把它交給了你認爲的人民的力量，我們一起做偉大的事情，真正相信理想，在這種情況下，我甚至不知道你會怎麼稱呼俄羅斯，但不管怎樣 但不管是什麼，那都是專制的、強大的國家、強大的領導人 相信這一點和相信美國的理想一樣美好 不僅僅如此，讓我補充一下你所說的 我很 我花了很多時間試圖擺脫我自己的偏見 我總是作爲一個美國人認爲這是他們的政府，這是他們的政府提出的一個理由，但你剛纔說的是，如果你能讓這個觀點變得美麗，這就是一種美麗的方式。中國人會說我們在美國所謂的人權 以及我們認爲是全世界每個人與生俱來的權利 其實是西方的權利 他們用的詞是西方的權利 啓蒙思想 嗯，關於什麼是人的權利，他們會建議，這不是國際的，永遠適用的權利，你可以做一個案例，我不相信這一點，這與我自己的個人觀點相悖，但你可以做一個案例，一個非常大的羣體的集體福祉 但你可以提出這樣的理由，即一大羣人的集體福祉勝過任何一個人的個人需求，特別是當這些事情相互衝突時，如果你不能爲更大的利益提供服務，因爲每個人都是如此的個人主義，那麼真正的更好的事情是什麼呢，對嗎，壓制個人主義，讓每個人都過得更好 嗯，我認爲試圖承認別人如何 如果我們想消除戰爭，就必須要認識到這一點 你說過要消除戰爭，我們也說過要消除衝突 首先要做的就是試着理解別人對某些事情的看法與自己不同 我是有名的那種相信傳統美國主義思想的人，對嗎？我是說，他們似乎認爲愛國主義需要相信強大的軍隊和我們今天擁有的所有這些東西，但這是對傳統美國主義的腐蝕，在共和國的前一百年裏，美國人對所有這些東西都持懷疑態度，因爲他們認爲這是美國人慶祝的事情的敵人，對吧？你怎麼可能有自由和個人主義的表達 如果你有一個壓倒一切的軍隊，總是在打仗 這個國家的創始人蔘考了其他的例子，比如歐洲，看到了常備軍，比如常備軍是自由的敵人 我們現在有一支常備軍 如果你能回到過去，和約翰-昆西-亞當斯談談 美國早期的總統，讓他看看我們現在的情況 他會認爲這很糟糕，很可怕，而且在某個地方，美國人已經迷失了方向，忘記了他們的宗旨 但我們已經成功地將這種現代的軍事工業綜合體 但我們卻成功地將現代軍事工業與美國傳統制度和意識形態交織在一起，以至於它們在我們的思維中交織在一起，而在150年前，它們實際上被認爲是兩極，是彼此的威脅 所以當你談到對國家的熱愛時，我傾向於懷疑這些東西 我傾向於懷疑政府，我傾向於傾向於懷疑 我很努力地不被操縱，我覺得他們所做的很大一部分是操縱和宣傳，所以我認爲對民族國家的健康懷疑實際上是傳統意義上的100個美國主義，但我也必須認識到，正如你雄辯地指出，美國主義不一定是普遍的，所以我認爲我們必須嘗試更加 傳統的美國人的觀點是，如果像中國這樣的地方不允許他們的人民享有個人的人權，那麼他們就被剝奪了一些東西，他們被剝奪了一些東西，而在100年前，他們會說這是上帝賦予的權利，人生而自由，如果他不自由，那是因爲對他做了一些事情，對，政府剝奪了他的上帝的權利。 賦予的權利 我一聽就興奮了 但我的意思是，我認爲 我認爲這個想法是普遍的，本身就是一種偏見 現在我是否希望其他人都有自由 我當然希望，但蘇聯的人真正相信這一點 希望世界上的工人團結起來，不要被剝削 你知道，那些貪婪的血 -- 貪婪的吸血者把他們幹得死去活來，把他們的勞動成果全部收入囊中 如果你這樣想的話，聽起來也是正義的，你知道的 所以這是個見仁見智的問題 我很想和你談談弗拉基米爾-普京，當我們在這種感覺和 我開始做這個播客的原因之一是，我相信有一些人我可以和他們交談，其中一些是自我，一些是愚蠢的。我一直在想的一個人是弗拉基米爾・普京 你還會說這門語言嗎？ 我的語言說得很好，這就更容易了 我是說你可能會被任命爲這個職位 這就是我問你這個問題的背景 你對弗拉基米爾・普京有什麼看法？ 從歷史背景來看，你研究過他嗎？ 你對他的看法是 嗯，研究是一個很重要的詞 嗯，這裏，這裏，再一次 我覺得有時候很難不通過美國的視角來過濾事物
所以作爲一個美國人我會說俄羅斯人應該被允許擁有他們想擁有的任何領導人 但是一個美國人會說但是應該有選舉的權利 所以如果俄羅斯人選擇Vladimir Putin並且他們繼續選擇他那是他們的事 而作爲一個美國人我會有一個問題就是當那個領導人不再讓俄羅斯人做決定的時候 我們會說現在你不再通過被統治者的同意來統治了 你已經成爲一個相當於可能壓迫你人民的人 你現在可能是一個獨裁者之間是有區別的自由選舉和重新 自由選舉和重新選舉的獨裁者之間是有區別的，如果這就是他們想要的，聽着，我... ...如果一概而論俄羅斯人是愚蠢的，就像一概而論任何人都是愚蠢的。 但他們似乎喜歡一個強大的掌舵人 聽着，有一大批美國人也是這樣做的 嗯，在他們自己的國家，但一個美國人會說，只要選擇的自由被賦予了 但美國人會說，只要把選擇的自由交給俄羅斯人，讓他們來決定，而不是剝奪他們的權利 說他是自由選舉出來的是一回事，但在很久以前，我們就取消了選舉，這也是另一回事 所以我對弗拉基米爾-普京的態度是，如果他是俄羅斯人民想要的人，你給他們選擇的權利 如果他在那裏只是因爲他們一直在選舉他 那就是一個非常不同的故事了 當他不再給他們提供選擇他或不選擇他的機會時 那就是它開始看起來很邪惡的時候了 對於一個出生和長大的人來說 心態和意識形態是你真正的一個組成部分 我不能 你知道你可以看到灰色地帶和細微差別 但你很難如願以償 你也提到了這一點 你很難擺脫在你成長過程中被灌輸到骨子裏的東西 就像退出一樣 你知道你的骨頭正在成長，你不能回頭 所以對我來說，這是我的一部分，我很難拋棄它，說哦，不，弗拉基米爾-普京不再當選了，這很好，我是我成長過程中的產物，不能去那裏，這有意義嗎？ 是的，當然，就像我們所說的，有灰色地帶 我相信我得好好想想，但我認爲在30年代的納粹德國，阿道夫-希特勒成爲了流行的選擇，這裏面有一個相同的方式，從美國的角度來看，你可以開始批評一些淺顯的方式，一些深刻的方式，而普京保持權力的方式是通過控制媒體。普京維持權力的方式是控制新聞界 所以限制了我們美國人所珍視的另一項自由 也就是新聞自由或言論自由 他很有可能現在事情正在發生變化 但在他擔任總統的大部分時間裏 他是最受歡迎的選擇 有時甚至是最受歡迎的 我在俄羅斯沒有真正的家人不愛普京 唯一給我寫信說普京不喜歡他的人是那種年輕的活動家，但對我來說他們是陌生人，我對他們一無所知 我認識的人在俄羅斯有一個大家庭，他們 他們喜歡普京，他們想念選舉，他們想通過投票箱來證明這一點，或者或者他們太愛他了，所以他們不想冒險讓別人把他選走，不，他們不這麼想，他們知道在俄羅斯潛伏着令人難以置信的官僚主義和腐敗。潛伏在暗處的腐敗，這在俄羅斯是真實的，到處都是，但就像俄羅斯人的某些東西，它是一種殘餘，它的腐敗是俄羅斯人深深的一部分，所以蘇維埃制度甚至被推翻，蘇維埃的解體，呃... 蘇聯的解體和普京的到來，改革了很多制度，它仍然深深地存在，他們意識到這一點，這就是對普京的熱愛，部分是基於對腐敗者接管、貪婪者接管後的恐懼，他們把普京看作是穩定劑 他們認爲普京是穩定器 就像一股強大的反作用力 反作用力就像把你的[__]放在一起一樣 基本上從西方人的角度來看普京是可怕的 但從俄羅斯人的角度來看普京是唯一能在它崩潰之前把它固定住的東西 現在，從像 加里-卡斯帕羅夫一直在大聲疾呼 你知道很多人從西方的角度說 如果它必須崩潰就讓它崩潰吧 你知道說起來容易做起來難 當你沒有經歷過那件事的時候 所以任何人都在擔心他們的家庭 他們也記得 他們還記得90年代蘇聯解體時發生的通貨膨脹和經濟不穩定，以及痛苦和飢餓，他們看到了普京掌權時發生的改革和經濟活力，他們認爲這傢伙在支撐着它，他們認爲選舉有可能是一個機制。他們認爲選舉有可能成爲腐敗分子不公平地操縱制度的機制 而不是讓人民用他們的聲音說話 他們想出了一個辦法來操縱選舉，選出像西方革命者那樣的人 所以我認爲對美國製度很重要的一個信念是選舉制度的信念，即人民的聲音可以在各種政府系統中被聽到 無論是司法系統還是 呃 我的意思是，基本的假設是這個系統運作良好，你可以呃選出 好吧，我想到了幾件事 第一件事是關於寡頭政治的想法 政治學上有一種信念 你知道這不是整體的信念，但每個社會都是一種寡頭政治，如果你把它細分的話 你說的是一些人，他們會在俄羅斯形成一個寡頭階層，而普京就是那個可以利用國家權力來控制這些人的人，當然，在這樣一個系統中，問題是一個強人系統，你有一個可以掌握繮繩的人。當這艘船處於風暴中的時候，有一個人可以控制和引導這艘船，這就是繼承人 如果你不建立一個沒有你也能運作的系統 那麼那個可怕的不穩定和可怕的未來，你認爲你是強者，就在等待着你的未來 除非他積極地建立制度，讓他活得更久，讓繼任者做他正在做的事情 那麼你在這裏做的就是創造一個暫時的 我認爲是暫時的穩定 因爲這和君主制下的問題是一樣的，對嗎？特別好，或者你認爲他特別好，但他會把這個工作交給其他人，而這個系統並不保證，因爲沒有人真正的工作，你會告訴我，如果普京正在建立我知道他多年來一直在談的 我知道他多年來一直在說要建立一個能夠超越他的制度，並且在他離開後能夠創造出俄羅斯人民喜歡的穩定局面，因爲如果寡頭們在之後接管了政權，那麼人們可能會說，我們有20年的良好穩定期，但我是說，如果我們談論的是一艘船 我是說如果我們談論的是一艘國家的船，也許你想從俄羅斯的角度來看，這艘船的掌舵人已經做得很好了，也許只是說說而已，但岩石仍然在那裏，他不會永遠掌舵，所以人們認爲他的工作是確保會有一個人 讓我問一下，因爲我很好奇，也很無知，所以他是這樣做的嗎，你認爲他是在設置，所以當沒有普京的時候，國家從一開始就很安全，這是他的想法，也是一個很吸引人的事情。我讀過所有關於普京的英文傳記，所以我還沒有，我需要更深入地思考，但其中一個有趣的事情是，權力是如何改變弗拉基米爾-普京的，他上臺的時候和現在不一樣，我其實在很多方面都很佩服這個上臺的人，我覺得他和斯大林很不一樣。他與斯大林和希特勒上臺時的情況截然不同 我認爲希特勒和斯大林在我們之前的討論中都已經走上了邪惡的道路 我認爲普京上臺時是一個謙遜忠誠的誠實人 他今天是一個值得思考和研究的人 我不確定 那是一句老話，雖然關於絕對的權力腐蝕絕對的權力，但這是你知道的，這是句話，嗯，你知道這是一句很好的話，但你必須真正思考一下，你知道這到底是什麼意思，就像我必須做的一件事，你知道我一直專注於確保對話，對嗎？我一直在確保對話的順利進行，所以我一直在努力，我還沒有經歷過一個黑暗的地方，因爲我覺得我不能做太久的黑暗的事情，所以我真的要把自己放在普京的心中，導致對話的進行，但現在我的感覺是，他在葉利欽給他的時候就已經上臺了，這是新中國的一個大動作。新俄羅斯歷史上第一次有一個領導人可以繼續掌權而選擇放棄權力 那是喬治-華盛頓在美國的權利，他認爲那是絕對積極的 是的，是好事的標誌，所以那是一個巨大的行爲 普京說，那是21世紀俄羅斯的決定性事件，他將把這面旗幟發揚光大 這就是爲什麼他在兩屆任期後將權力交給梅德韋傑夫的原因 是的，但那是一個傀儡 是的，但那是一個故事，我想他很早就相信了。我想他一開始就相信了 我想他 我想他現在仍然相信 但我想他對隱藏在暗處的腐敗深惡痛絕 我確實相信 作爲一個認爲點擊率高的新聞業已經壞了的人 記者讓我很惱火 新聞業的工作很完美 新聞業的壞了 記者讓事情變得很好 所以我從普京的角度理解新聞業 記者可以被視爲國家的敵人 因爲人們認爲記者寫了這些深刻而美麗的哲學作品 關於批評政府的結構
和正確的政策 你知道我們需要採取什麼措施來建立一個更偉大的國家 不，他們不公平地斷章取義，他們的批評方式很膚淺，不有趣 他們說你是種族主義者或性別歧視者，或者他們一直在編造東西 所以我可以把自己放在一個人的心態上，認爲從系統中移除這種膚淺的呃假新聞的聲音是可以的 問題是，當然這是一個滑坡，然後你 從系統中刪除所有令人討厭的人，然後你改變了令人討厭的含義，令人討厭開始成爲一件事，就像任何反對這個系統的人，我的意思是，我明白，嗯，很明顯，它成爲一個滑坡，但我也可以把自己放在人們的心態中，認爲從系統中刪除騙子是可以的，只要它對俄羅斯有好處，好的，所以這裏的謊言，這又是傳統的美國觀點，因爲我們已經有黃色，所以 - 因爲自共和國成立以來，我們就有黃色新聞，這不是什麼新鮮事，但問題是，當你清除了記者，甚至你知道這是一個寬泛的問題，因爲你既清除了那些說謊的蹩腳的記者，也清除了那些說真話的記者，你只剩下那些被認可的政府記者，對，那些支持政府的人。在這種情況下，你所看到的真相是一種不同的假新聞，是政府的假新聞，而不是點擊率很高的新聞，哦，對了，也許真相也混在其中，在一些媒體中。我在新聞界工作了30年，我的工作是在互聯網之前翻閱所有的報紙，並找到我以前認識的所有記者的名字，我可以挑出他們是誰，我很難從假話中挑出真相，所以我經常想，那些沒有這些背景的人，他們有生活，或者接受過其他專業的培訓，他們是怎麼做到的？他們是如何做到的，但如果政府是唯一被認可的真相渠道，一個傳統的美國人和其他很多基於我之前談到的啓蒙思想的傳統社會會認爲這是一場等待發生的災難或正在進行的暴政，這是否有意義，完全有意義，我同意你的觀點，我仍然同意你的觀點，但很明顯， 但很明顯，新聞自由和言論自由在今天，就像過去幾年的互聯網一樣，正在發生變化，你知道，你可以說美國的言論自由系統已經壞了，因爲這裏是我長大的信念，我仍然堅持，但我開始嘗試看到多種觀點，我的信念是，言論自由是一個穩定的軌跡。我的信念是，言論自由的結果是一個穩定的軌跡，總是走向真理，所以像真理會出現，這是我的信仰和信念，是的，會有謊言到處都是，但會有一個穩定的東西是真實的，被帶到公衆面前，現在感覺有可能走向一個世界，沒有什麼是真的，或者真理是一羣人的東西。是一羣人說服自己的東西，而且有多羣人，一些普遍真理的想法，我想是更好的東西，呃是我們不能再存在的東西，比如有些人相信綠灣包裝工是最好的呃足球隊，有些人可以認爲是愛國者，他們深深相信它，他們稱其他羣體爲騙子，現在這很有趣，對 但他們可能會相信科學，相信政治的各個方面，相信我們政府職能中不同政策的各個方面，這不僅僅是我們抱怨的一些奇怪的事情，而是事情的本質，比如真相是我們不能再擁有的東西，讓我們，讓我去 讓我們把美國的歷史也浪漫化，因爲美國的新聞界經常是有偏見的，就像我的意思是，我總是把1970年代看成是美國新聞界的高水位，在後水門事件的時代，它是積極的。 水門事件後的時代，它積極追擊政府的濫用權力和所有這些事情，但有一個著名的演講，非常安靜，雖然非常安靜，由凱瑟琳-格雷厄姆給出，她是華盛頓郵報的編輯，我相信，呃，實際上有人把它送給我，我們不得不把它從一個新聞學像Jstor那種東西上拿到，她在一個午餐會上 她在一個午餐會上向政府人員保證 不要擔心，這不會成爲我們的一個趨勢，我們不會，因爲政府的立場仍然是被承載的 你知道，報紙是水，報紙是大事情，直到60年代末70年代初，報紙仍然是 報紙仍然是政府的載體 對，他們是報紙所有者的載體 所以我們不要假裝有一些天使般的美好時光 我對我說，因爲我是提出這個問題的人 我們不要假裝有一個真實的新聞報道的超級時代，所有這些 我的意思是，你去看美國曆史上的革命時期，它看起來和今天一樣糟糕，對嗎？ 這是一個充滿希望的信息，所以事情可能沒有他們看起來那麼糟糕。 讓我們把它看得更像一個股票市場，你有波動的真實性或或新聞的可信度，有一些時期，它比其他時期高。 所謂的點擊率 關於所謂的點擊時代，我認爲它很糟糕，但我的意思是，它類似於早期的時代，所以我總是把它與我還是個孩子的時候進行比較，當時我認爲新聞業是有史以來最好的，它從來沒有完美過，但這也是你在其他政府中很少看到的東西 在世界範圍內，記者經常被殺害是有原因的 在很多國家，這是因爲他們報道了當局不希望報道的事情 我一直認爲這是新聞業應該做的事情，但它必須是真實的，否則 這只是一種不同的宣傳方式 我們能談談成吉思汗嗎？ 成吉思汗 當然，順便說一下，是成吉思汗還是成吉思汗？ 不是成吉思汗，是成吉思汗還是成吉思汗 所以我們就說成吉思汗吧 我唯一能說的就是成吉思汗 就像我不知道GIF和JIF的區別 我不知道怎麼開始的 是的，首先你關於成吉思汗的劇集對很多人來說是最喜歡的了 想到那些有如此大影響的事件是很迷人的 在你看來，他是一個邪惡的人嗎？ 這與我們對邪惡的討論有關。 另一種說法是，我讀到他在世界許多地方，如蒙古，都很受歡迎。我經常說我不是一個歷史學家，這就是爲什麼我試圖把這些次要的主題帶入硬核歷史播客，所以每個節目都有這些次要的主題，而且它們不是我試圖軟化的。在那一集裏，"軟踏板 "的次主題與我們所說的 "歷史縱火犯 "有關，因爲一些歷史學家認爲，有時，而且大部分都是早期的，所以歷史學家不常這樣做，但這些都是我長大後提出的奇妙問題，它幾乎是歷史和哲學之間的交叉點，其想法是，有時世界已經被官僚主義或腐敗或只是停滯的現象所淹沒，有人必須 有很多這樣的時期，過去的歷史學家會把這些進來做了可怕事情的人物描繪成爲人類創造了幾乎是服務的人，呃，爲一個新的世界創造了基礎，將比舊的世界更好，這是一個反覆出現的主題，所以這是弊端播客的次要主題，否則你不需要我告訴你。因爲不然的話，你不需要我告訴你蒙古人的故事，但我要提出歷史上的縱火者因素，嗯，但這涉及到可汗如何被描繪的問題，如果你想說，哦，是的，他清除了枯木，爲一個好的，那麼這是一個積極的事情，如果你說我的家人在他的森林大火中。如果你說我的家人在他放的森林大火中，你就不會這麼看了 嗯，成吉思汗的功勞都是正面的，所以像宗教寬容這樣的事情，你會說他在宗教上是 呃，蒙古人在宗教上是寬容的，所以這讓他們 所以這使他們成爲一個自由主義的改革者 但這需要在他們的帝國背景下看待 這很像羅馬人的觀點，即羅馬人並不關心當地人崇拜的東西，他們要的是穩定，如果能保持穩定，保持你的稅收，不需要 只要能保持穩定，不需要軍團進駐，他們就不在乎，對不對？ 共和黨也是如此，他們不在乎你信仰什麼，只要不破壞他們的帝國，不給他們帶來麻煩，但我總想指出的是，但 但汗還是可以帶着他的代表來到你的城鎮 決定你的女兒是個漂亮的女人，他們想成爲汗的妃子，他們就會帶走她們 所以這是個多麼自由的帝國，對嗎？ 所以很多他們得到讚譽的事情，好像是某種好人的事情 從另一個角度看，這可能只是一種簡單的控制機制 對，一種保持帝國穩定的方法 他們這樣做並不是出於善意 他們認爲這是最好的 我喜歡，因爲蒙古人是我們所說的異教徒
我喜歡他們，我想我們稱之爲... ...我忘了我們用的是什麼詞了... ...這與他們在宗教上的賭注有關... ...他們不知道哪個神是正確的 所以只要你們都在爲大汗的健康祈禱... ...我們就能最大限度地增加機會... ...不管神是誰，他們都能得到這個消息... 它更多的是爲了征服世界 就像說我們要通過征服世界來實現穩定 如果是希特勒呢？ 他也可以這樣說 或者希特勒並不是真正的世界征服者 因爲他不會這樣做 他不會試圖讓所有的人都平等 但是我的觀點是，如果他們的動機不是積極的 如果他們的動機不是積極的道德傾向 蒙古人並不這麼看 我認爲這種描述的方式就像 我總是喜歡用這個比喻 但這就像射箭後在周圍畫上靶心 我們如何證明他們是正確的 並使他們看起來很好 除非我們沒有蒙古人的觀點 蒙古人的祕密歷史 有一些東西是由蒙古統治者寫下來的 通過波斯和中國的抄寫員 後來我們沒有他們的觀點 但是這看起來不像是在創造一個美好的地方 每個人都過着比以前更好的生活 我想那是後來的人把它說得很美好 因爲我在推測，我對征服這麼多土地的想法是... ...意識形態是新出現的... ...所以如果我猜測蒙古人一開始就像戰士一樣... ...重視卓越的殺戮技巧... ...甚至是殺戮，但是像實際的戰爭實踐... 你發展了一套思想，你可以像你說的那樣建立控制，但它是新興的，似乎蒙古人的核心的第一原則思想就是成爲優秀的戰士 對我來說，這就是起點 不是像希特勒和斯大林那樣的意識形態 希特勒有一種意識形態，但它與戰爭沒有任何關係，它更注重征服。我覺得蒙古人開始的時候更有組織性 我想說的是，這種現象開始出現了 他們就像美國本土的科曼奇人一樣 就像Joe Rogan現在所迷戀的不同的戰士部落一樣 這讓我更多地去研究它 他們似乎只是開始重視戰鬥的技巧 他們有可能把它變成一門科學 認爲一開始就沒有意識形態，這是不是太瘋狂了？ 我要退一步說，我想起了關於羅馬人的一句話，他們創造了一片荒地，並稱之爲和平，這是令人驚歎的，但是，但是有很多征服者都是這樣的，對嗎？ 你會坐在那裏聽，歷史學家永遠有它的特點，這是著名的交易 他們會說，看看他們促進的貿易，看看他們的宗教，所有這些東西，但它們是以所有那些被他們強行征服的民族爲代價的，並且通過武力融入他們的帝國 我們需要記住蒙古人的一件事，使他們與羅馬人不同，這是複雜的東西，遠遠超過我的工資等級 但我很着迷，就像你剛纔提到的科曼奇人一樣 蒙古人不是一個定居的社會 好吧，他們是，他們來自遊牧民族的傳統 現在幾代之後，當你有一個庫比拉汗作爲中國的皇帝時 這就開始是另一回事了 對，蒙古人在他們的帝國解體後 所謂的定居社會，對吧，伊朗這樣的地方，隨着時間的推移，他們會變得更像那些地方的統治者，而蒙古人，比如說像黃金部落的同義詞，仍然在他們傳統的遊牧地區，仍然是傳統意義上的蒙古人。但當你開始談論誰是蒙古人的時候，我試着把他們區分開來 他們並不是什麼非常特別的人 他們只是一個最新的聯盟，而這個地區的遊牧聯盟可以追溯到有記載的歷史之初，斯基泰人、薩爾馬特人、阿瓦人、匈奴人、馬雅人 歐亞大草原的遊牧民族在世界歷史上扮演着巨大的角色 直到火藥使他們的傳統武器系統失效 我一直對他們的傳統武器系統很着迷 因爲他們的傳統武器系統不是你能複製的 因爲你在說要成爲最偉大的戰士 我所見過的每一個戰士社會的價值觀都是這樣的 遊牧民族的歐亞階梯是人類和動物之間的關係，它改變了這個等式 他們騎着馬，像拜占庭這樣的社會形成了階梯的一個側翼 然後一直到另一邊，你有中國和 這些社會都試圖創造出使用弓箭的騎兵，他們做得很好，但他們永遠無法與遊牧民族相提並論，因爲那些人是在馬鞍上長大的，他們把他們比作半人馬，科曼奇就是很好的例子，被認爲是北美最好的騎馬者 被認爲是北美最好的騎馬戰士 科曼奇人 我一直很喜歡看畫 喬治-卡特林，著名的畫家，他畫了科曼奇人的圖畫 但蒙古人，斯基泰人，斯基泰人，阿瓦人和所有這些人也是這樣做的 他們會從馬的脖子下面射擊，躲在後面 躲在馬的後面 你看別人這樣做的照片，真是太瘋狂了 這是拜占庭人做不到的，中國人也做不到的 這是利用人與動物關係的另一個層次，給他們帶來了軍事上的優勢，這是無法複製的，可以模仿的，但他們永遠也做不到。但他們永遠也做不到這一點 這就是爲什麼他們總是僱傭這些人 僱傭這些地區的僱傭兵，因爲他們是無可比擬的 所以那些從幼兒時期就開始射弓箭的人的組合 他們一直在騎馬 羅馬人說，因爲他們從不外出，他們在馬鞍上吃了所有的東西，創造了一些難以複製的東西，這給他們帶來了軍事上的優勢 你知道我很喜歡閱讀關於 呃，當這種軍事優勢結束時，17和18世紀，中國人在一側，俄羅斯人在另一側，開始使用 火器和其他東西來打破這些軍事力量 這些不同的弊端 嗯，蒙古人是最有統治力和最成功的聯盟 但如果你把它拆開，他們真的形成了金字塔頂端的核心 食物鏈的頂點，很多被稱爲蒙古人的人實際上是很多其他部落的非 當蒙古人征服你的時候，他們殺了很多人，他們把你納入他們的聯盟，並經常讓你先走，你知道你要和別人打，我們要讓這些人走在前面，在我們進去完成工作之前吸走所有的箭。所以對我來說，我想一個蒙古人的粉絲會說，蒙古人的不同之處並不在於武器系統或戰鬥或戰士或盔甲或任何東西，而在於成吉思汗 如果你去看看其他真正危險的外部世界的觀點，過去歷史上危險的遊牧聯盟的步驟總是當一些 你在美國本土歷史上也看到了同樣的事情，二度二 你有像阿提拉這樣的人，對嗎？ 或者有一個叫Twomin的人 你回到歷史上，這些人成爲歷史書上的人物，因爲他們給他們定居的鄰居帶來了大量的麻煩，通常是 我的意思是，中國、波斯和拜占庭對草原人的態度總是一樣的 他們會挑選一些部落與之友好相處 他們會給他們錢，給他們禮物，僱傭他們，利用他們來對付其他部落 一般來說，拜占庭特別是中國的外交史都是爲了保持這些部落的分離 不要讓他們形成大量的部落聯盟，因爲那樣他們就不可阻擋了 阿提拉就是一個很好的例子 匈奴人是另一個大部落 土耳其人是另一個由這些人組成的大部落聯盟 他們一旦聯合起來就會造成巨大的破壞 所以外交政策就是不要讓他們聯合起來 這就是蒙古人的不同之處 成吉思汗把他們聯合起來，然後不像大多數部落聯盟那樣，他能夠 他們能夠在幾代人的時間裏保持團結，在他們開始拉動的小線上徘徊，成吉思汗是一個領導者 是的，你認爲什麼是一個偉大的領導者 也許你有歷史上其他的例子，偉大的 再一次讓我們丟掉這個詞吧 現在他要問一個定義 偉大的團結者 不管是邪惡的還是善良的都無所謂 有沒有什麼人讓你印象深刻 亞歷山大-恩典 談到軍事或意識形態 有些人提到了FDR或我的意思是可能是這個國家的開國元勳或者是我們 我們可以去看看，他是一個世紀之人，20世紀的希特勒和斯大林，這些人真的積累了大量的權力，可能在世界歷史上從未見過。
這是個有趣的問題，我想了很多 因爲我們以亞歷山大大帝爲例 亞歷山大讓他那個時代的世界爲之着迷 從那時起人們就對這個人着迷了 但亞歷山大是個世襲的君主 對，他是被賦予王國的，這很吸引人 對，但他不需要白手起家就能得到這份工作 實際上他讓我想起了 事實上，他讓我想起了弗雷德裏克大帝的很多其他領導人，比如普魯士的這些人，他們繼承了當時最偉大的軍隊 亞歷山大除非是低能兒，否則無論如何都會成爲偉大的人，因爲我的意思是，如果你繼承了德國國防軍，你就能用它做些什麼，對嗎？ 亞歷山大的父親可能是更偉大的菲利普 呃，菲利普二世就是那個真正從一個脫節的地方創造出一個強大王國的傢伙 一羣被鄰國不斷圍攻的人 他是改革軍隊的人 他從其他希臘領導人那裏學到的東西 比如Pemanandes的Theban領導人 嗯，然後在他的一生中辛苦地穩定了邊境，建立了這個系統 他失去了一隻眼睛，他 他的腿被弄瘸了 我的意思是，他這是一個看起來像他建立帝國的人，從前排領導 我是說... ...然後... ...他可能被他的兒子殺死了 我們不知道是誰刺殺了菲利普... ...但是他把世界上最偉大的軍隊交給了他的兒子... ...他用它做了很多偉大的事情 有一句老話，你知道它是一種誹謗，但它是關於富人的，就像他出生在他出生在三壘上，並認爲他打了一個三倍的權利 嗯，菲利普出生在本壘上，他不得不打亞歷山大開始在三壘上，所以我試圖區分他們成吉思汗是困難的，因爲有兩個傳統，我們在美國長大的傳統，我長大的學習是，他是一個自 但也有一個傳統，這可能是一種事後的說法，因爲在很久以前，你的血管裏是否有藍色的血液是一個重要的區別，所以你經常從蒙古歷史中聽到的區別是，這是一個被剝奪了遺產的貴族 他是一個被剝奪了繼承權的貴族，所以他是一個藍血人 我不知道哪個是真的，當然，我的意思是，當你看到成吉思汗的時候，你不得不說，這是一個邪惡的事情，他的成就，作爲一個人物，阿提拉是非常令人印象深刻的人物 希特勒是一個有趣的人物，他是其中之一 因爲你對希特勒的研究越多 你就越想知道他的決定性時刻在哪裏 因爲如果你看看他的生活 我是說希特勒在第一次世界大戰中是個比較普通的士兵 他很勇敢，他得到了一些勳章 事實上他在第一次世界大戰中得到的最高勳章 事實上，他在一戰中獲得的最高勳章是由一位猶太軍官授予的，他經常不談這個勳章，儘管它是更有聲望的勳章，因爲這將打開一整罐你不想進入的麻煩，但希特勒的 我的意思是，如果你今天說誰是希特勒，你會說他是一個反猶主義者。 那麼你就必須區分一般的反猶太主義和狂熱的反猶太主義 但希特勒似乎並沒有表現出狂熱的反猶太主義 但希特勒似乎在一戰結束後才表現出狂熱的反猶太主義 所以如果這是這個人性格中的一個決定性部分 我們認爲他的邪惡大多來自於這個人成年後發生的事情 對，他已經參加了戰爭，改變了他 所以我是說這幾乎是 就像以前有部電影的主題一樣 有人被什麼東西打到了頭，整個人都變了，對吧？ 我的意思是，這幾乎是類似的事情，所以我不認爲這一定是個偉大的領袖，對我來說，希特勒的有趣之處在於一個非 一個非描述性的人，他的技能並沒有給任何人留下深刻的印象，然後在20世紀20年代，他突然就像你說的那樣，成爲了風雲人物，對吧，所以對我來說，這有點快。 然後他在這種環境下長大，各方面的壓力都很大，所以你從這塊鑽石開始，然後你把它打磨得很硬，他的一生中，希特勒似乎都是一塊非常不起眼的寶石，然後突然之間，所以我的意思是，我不認爲我可以給偉大的領導人貼標籤，我總是被這種想法所吸引，我試圖記住誰說的那句話，偉大的人哦，主啊，所以偉大的人往往不是好人。爲了成爲偉大的人，你必須放棄許多道德品質，我們通常會考慮耶穌或甘地，或者你知道這些品質，人們把它們看作是好的正直的道德品質，我們都應該向往的榜樣，對吧，菩薩，不管它是什麼，那些人不會成爲好的領導者，因爲你需要成爲一個好的領導者，往往需要那種選擇，一個真正的哲學的道德的人不會做。所以我不知道該如何回答你的問題 這是個很長的說法，我不知道，我只是想說，從我對希特勒的研究來看，時代塑造了他，而成吉思汗則是他塑造了他的時代 是的，我對那些遊牧民族的聯盟建設者也有這種感覺，他們似乎是這些人物，在某種程度上很突出，記得幾乎所有的歷史 他們的歷史都是由他們的敵人寫的，他們被虐待得很厲害，他們可能永遠不會得到任何好的新聞，他們沒有自己寫。 這是一個警告，我們應該總是 是的，基本上游牧民族或美洲原住民或任何地方的部落人民通常沒有優勢，能夠寫出他們英雄的歷史 好吧，我，呃，我最近幾乎完成了第三帝國的崛起和衰落，這是希特勒的歷史描述之一。這是對希特勒上臺的歷史描述 納粹上臺後，我想問你幾個哲學問題 看看你是否能幫上忙 我想的一個問題是，在30年代的德國納粹，一個人如何成爲英雄 什麼叫英雄？我們能想到的任何一個國家，但也不是沒有可能，專制政府佔據主導地位，專制公司佔據主導地位，我想，我可以以我小小的方式，激勵其他人在事情變得糟糕之前採取英雄行動，我試圖把自己放在1930年代的德國是什麼樣子，是否有可能阻止希特勒，這甚至是正確的思考方式，一個人如何成爲其中的英雄，我是說你經常談論 你經常說，經歷歷史的某一時刻與回顧歷史是完全不同的 當你回顧歷史的時候，我也在想，是否有可能理解正在發生的事情 戰爭的鐘聲正在敲響 似乎大多數人在30年代後期都不理解戰爭即將到來 這很吸引人，在美國方面，在德國內部，比如反對派人物，德國軍隊似乎都不理解這一點 也許另一個國家，當然是法國和英國，似乎也不明白這一點 我想把自己放到30年代的德國，因爲我是猶太人 這是另一個小小的轉折，比如我應該怎麼做，一個人應該怎麼做 你有什麼有趣的答案嗎？ 所以早些時候我們談到了普京，我們談到了愛國主義和愛國這些東西 爲了成爲納粹德國的英雄，根據我們的觀點，你必須是反 在1930年代的德國人看來 你必須反對自己的政府和國家 這是一件非常奇怪的事情 對德國人說 你要被視爲一個好的德國人和國家的英雄 反對你的領導 你要反對你的政府的政策 你要反對你的政府 你要希望併爲它的垮臺而努力 這聽起來並不愛國，在這個國家聽起來也不愛國 如果你 如果你提出類似的論點，我就不說30年代了，說說40年代來回答你的問題 德國的白玫瑰運動等運動，有來自不同背景和宗教的年輕人蔘加 這些年輕人會出去散發小冊子，他們中的許多人因爲他們的麻煩而被斷頭臺砍掉了腦袋，他們知道這將是一種懲罰，這是一種非凡的勇敢和犧牲精神，他們願意去死，甚至不願意。他們甚至不願意，因爲他們是如此公開，這幾乎是一種肯定，嗯，這對我來說是令人難以置信的感動，所以當我們談論，我們早些時候談到了人類精神和所有這些東西，例如，德國軍隊中有一些人反對希特勒，並努力反對希特勒，但對我來說，與這些年輕人在白玫瑰運動中所做的相比，這幾乎是懦弱的，因爲那些在佛蒙特州的人，例如，祕密地試圖破壞希特勒
他們並沒有把自己的生命放在同樣的程度上 所以我認爲當我看到英雄的時候 聽着 我記得曾經說過在德國沒有良心拒服兵役者 以此來向人們指出你沒有選擇 你知道你要在那裏服役 我收到了耶和華見證會的信 他們說有的 我們被送進了集中營 這些都是非常勇敢的事情 有自己的一套標準和價值觀是一回事，但在這個政權下，我要用一種方式來展示它們，那是一種死刑，不僅對我，對我的家人也是如此 在這些政權下，父親、兒子和妻子之間沒有什麼區別 這是很了不起的犧牲，遠遠超出了我的能力 欽佩之情來自於那些看起來比你自己更有道德感的人 所以當我看到這些的時候，我看着那些東西，我只是說，哇 有趣的是，如果你在1942年在街上找到大多數普通德國人，說你怎麼看這些人 他們會認爲他們是商人，可能是罪有應得 這就是國家的力量 嗯，以有利於國家的方式宣傳價值觀和道德觀 嗯，你可以把今天我們看成是不可思議的勇敢和道德的人，爲正義而奮鬥的人，把他們變成人民的敵人 嗯，所以我的意思是，在我心目中，會是這樣的人 看，我覺得所以英雄是一個有趣的詞，我們把這個概念浪漫化 但如果我可以把你從1940年代拉回到30年代的德國 當然我覺得像 我覺得沒有什麼成就的英雄行爲並不是我所指的 所以有很多我仰慕的英雄，比如大衛-戈金斯，那個跑得很遠的人，他跑步沒有什麼目的，只是爲了忍受本身的痛苦，我覺得他願意挑戰自己思想的極限就是英雄 我想我在找一個不同的詞，就是希特勒怎麼可能被阻止？我覺得他可以在思想鬥爭中被阻止 數百萬人在經濟上受苦 或者因爲一戰的背叛而受苦 在愛國方面，他們覺得自己受到了對待 導致希特勒的權力上升，並創造了條件，使他的信息產生了共鳴 這不是一個在任何時候都能產生共鳴的信息，對嗎？ 如果不處理第一次世界大戰和第一次世界大戰的後果，就不可能理解希特勒的崛起 德國的通貨膨脹和可怕的蕭條，以及所有這些事情，對魏瑪共和國政府的不滿 經常被認爲是戰勝國的產物 希特勒把簽署協議的人稱爲 "十一月罪犯" 他用這句話與民衆產生了共鳴 這是一個被激怒的民衆 即使他們不被激怒 你可以通過魏瑪共和國工作，但他們試過了，反正也不行了 然後替代納粹的是共產主義煽動者，他們是街上的惡霸，對一般保守的德國人來說，似乎也好不到哪裏去 所以你有三個選擇，如果你是一個普通的德國人 你可以選擇由你的敵人掌權的信譽不佳的政府，反正也不行了 你可以選擇納粹，他們似乎是一羣 你可以選擇納粹，他們就像一羣超級愛國者 呼籲恢復德國的權威 或者你可以選擇共產黨 整個事情看起來就像一連串糟糕的選擇 對，在這個領域裏，希特勒能夠進行三角合作 如果你願意的話 他就像一個要恢復德國偉大的人 在那個時候，這是一個強有力的信息 但如果你不需要恢復德國的偉大，就不會產生共鳴 我認爲在那個時代是行不通的 因爲那不是普通德國人所追求的東西 思考一下偉大是否可以通過一些機制來恢復 從我們今天的角度來看是不太合適的 被法國人佔領了 所以從來沒有允許你讓仇恨消散的時候 每當事情趨於平靜的時候 就會有別的事情發生，把刀子插進去，從普通德國人的角度看，就會有更多的扭曲 對了，如果你說好吧，我們要重新站起來了 賠償金把這些東西壓垮了，阻止了愛或兄弟情誼和所有這些東西的想法，即使有 即使有德國人有這種感覺，當然也有 但很難戰勝其他人的力量 你知道當人們和我談起人性時，我總是說 我相信在個人層面上，我們有能力做任何事情 好的、壞的或無所謂的事情 但集體是不同的，對嗎？被苦難和仇恨所淹沒 老實說，你不斷地被你以前的敵人虐待的感覺 盟軍中有很多人意識到這一點，並說我們在爲下一場戰爭做準備 這是我的意思是，他們明白，你只能在一定時間內對集體的人做某些事情，然後他們纔會自然而然地想去做，你可以看到該地區的德國海報，納粹的宣傳海報顯示他們 我的意思是說，德國是清醒的，這是偉大的口號，所以我認爲愛總是一個困難的選擇，在那個時代的背景下，它甚至比正常情況下更無能爲力，這只是爲了在歷史上多停留一會兒，你認爲希特勒可以被阻止嗎？你認爲有什麼辦法可以避免嗎？ 我是說有兩個問題，一個是可能更糟，另一個是可能更好 在30年代和40年代的歷史軌跡中，最合乎邏輯的是... ...我們開始這個談話時，給討論帶來了一個美妙的領結，並且很好地扣住了它 我們早些時候談到了武力對抗武力的問題 最明顯也是討論最多的方法是，希特勒本可以被阻止的，這與德國人無關 當他重新 當他把萊茵河地區重新軍事化的時候，大家都在談論幾個法國師會做什麼，如果他們只是進去爭奪的話，這對希特勒來說是非常重要的，我的意思是，這可能是他整個職業生涯中最緊張的時刻，因爲他害怕他們會用武力來回應，而他卻無能爲力。因爲他擔心他們會用武力回應，而他又無能爲力 所以這時就會有人說 你知道我的意思，丘吉爾也是這些人中的一員 他們會說，他應該在一開始就用軍事手段阻止他，那時他還很虛弱 我不認爲在天主教中心黨和魏瑪共和國的其他候選人 可能會有所作爲 這超出了我對德國具體歷史的理解，不能明智地談論它 但我確實認爲，如果法國對希特勒在該地區的最初行動作出軍事反應，他就會受挫 我想他自己也相信，如果我記得我的閱讀 嗯，這將導致他的垮臺，所以潛在的看到我 我不喜歡的是，它幾乎是合法的軍事幹預 在一個非常早期的階段，以防止更糟糕的事情發生 但它可能是一個相當明確的 但也應該指出，盟軍方面有很多同情，你知道德國人可能應該把德國奪回來，這是傳統的德國土地 我的意思是，他們以一種有趣的方式在嘗試 幾乎就像盟軍方面的愛和正義感，可能實際上已經阻止了他們的行動，這將防止更多更多的事情發生 但如果當時的時代讓希特勒的信息產生了共鳴 那麼簡單地把希特勒從等式中剔除 就不會消除當時的時代背景 這意味着有兩種情況 要麼你會有另一個希特勒 要麼你會在不同的方向上陷入同樣糟糕的局面 我不知道這意味着什麼 因爲很難想象有什麼會比 但歷史就是這麼有趣 希特勒總是大家最喜歡的例子 說明歷史上的偉人理論和歷史上的趨勢和力量理論之間的區別 對，時代使希特勒成爲可能，甚至對某些人來說是可取的 如果你把他排除在外，那些趨勢和力量仍然存在，對嗎？那麼這意味着什麼呢？ 如果你把他排除在外，門還是開着的，會不會有其他人走過去呢？ 從數學上講，有魅力的領導人出現的概率很高 我很糾結這個問題，我在這一點上有另一種看法 在那個時期，德國的體制穩定，不足以反擊，德國曆史上還有其他時期
希特勒在1913年在亞利桑那州出現，他沒有得到任何好處 因爲德國的體制力量足以壓制它 是德國不穩定的事實阻止了一個統一戰線 因爲我不知道該如何思考這個問題 二戰與大屠殺 我們剛纔在討論歷史的發展方式 希特勒是否能被阻止 我覺得我是說我不知道，我們剛剛在討論他從哪裏獲得了對猶太人的仇恨，在維也納有一些故事，等等，他幾乎是把反猶太主義的想法作爲一個非常有用的工具，而不是真正相信它，在他的內心深處，你認爲第二次世界大戰的結果和希特勒的結果是可能的，如果沒有反猶太主義。 如果沒有反猶太主義，我們是否可以避免大屠殺，或者它是法西斯主義意識形態的一個組成部分，而納粹不是法西斯主義的一個組成部分，因爲墨索里尼真的 我是說墨索里尼這樣做是爲了取悅希特勒，但它不是一個組成部分 對我來說，有趣的是，這是整個問題中最大的反常現象，因爲反猶太主義不需要。 因爲反猶太主義根本不需要成爲這個問題的一部分 對，希特勒對世界有一種陰謀論的看法 他相信猶太人控制着一切 對，猶太人對布爾什維克主義和資本主義都負有責任 他們統治着銀行 我是說美國是一個猶太人的國家 對，布爾什維克主義是一個猶太人的政黨 換句話說，他認爲猶太人無處不在 他有一句話，如果歐洲的猶太人再向德國逼迫戰爭 他們將付出代價 但你必須相信他們有這個能力 大屠殺是整個事件的一個奇怪的副產品 我一直覺得這很有趣，它是一個削弱德國的副產品 因爲看看第一次世界大戰，猶太人爲德國而戰 對，誰是最重要的，這是一個非常有爭議的觀點 但這只是我腦子裏浮現的第一個人 誰是最重要的猶太人，如果德國人有一個非 聽着，整個風格的一部分，是的，是愛因斯坦，但整個我應該指出，說德國或歐洲或俄羅斯或任何這些東西是不反猶太的。 是對歷史的不公正 對，到處都是大屠殺 我的意思是，那是標準的操作程序 你在希特勒時代看到的絕對是一個巨大的高峯 對，因爲政府有一個猶太人的陰謀論 很有趣，因爲希特勒既認爲他們是弱者，又認爲他們是超級強者 因爲希特勒既認爲他們是弱者，又認爲他們是超級強者 對，作爲一個局外人，我們可以加入整個血液的概念，以及它與達爾文主義的聯繫，所有這些東西都很奇怪，對，一個真正的例外，但愛因斯坦，讓我們用愛因斯坦來玩，如果德國沒有反 如果德國沒有反猶太主義，或者沒有高於正常水平的反猶太主義，那麼愛因斯坦會不會和其他所有的猶太科學家一起離開，我的意思是，如果他們留下來，德國會有什麼技術和智力的提高呢？在希特勒的世界觀中，這是一個悲劇性的缺陷 但它是如此，而且我不認爲你之前提到的 也許這不是他性格中不可或缺的東西 也許這是一個很好的權力工具 我不認爲，在某條線上，真的不是一開始 這傢伙就完全沉迷於陰謀論和猶太人，而且 他身邊有很多人和理論家 我想用這個詞來形容，他們也相信這個理論 所以你有一個陰謀集團，他們在強化這個想法 猶太人控制了世界 他稱國際珠寶是問題的重要組成部分 他們應該受到懲罰，他們是內部的敵人，所有這些事情。 這是一個瘋狂的陰謀論，一個最重要的政府，我的意思是，德國的大事是文化，他們是他們是文化和哲學的領導人物，所有這些事情，他們可以被超越。他們會被這種瘋狂的詭異的陰謀論所取代 這將決定一切 希特勒利用大量的德國資源來消滅這個種族 而他需要這些資源來進行各種其他的戰爭 最黑暗的一線希望是大屠殺可能是在對猶太人的仇恨中發生的 可能是避免德國首先得到核武器的原因 這難道不是一個美妙的歷史諷刺性轉折嗎？ 如果它沒有被悲劇所覆蓋 一千年後會被看作是非常有趣的事情 是的，這是真的，這很吸引人，就像你說的那樣 他自己毀滅的種子，是的，悲劇性的缺陷 我希望這是我和我父親的討論，作爲一個物理學家 邪惡本來就包含了那種無能 我父親的討論，他是一個物理學家 和工程師，他認爲在我們歷史上的這個時候，我們還沒有出現核彈，比如恐怖分子，呃，在世界某個地方炸燬核武器的原因是，那種會成爲恐怖分子的人根本沒有足夠的能力來完成他們的破壞性工作，所以就像有一種如果你策劃它，你越邪惡 我說的邪惡是指純粹的，就像我們說的那樣... ...如果我們把對猶太人的仇恨視爲邪惡... ...因爲它有點脫離現實... ...就像對某種東西的純粹仇恨... 你越是屈服於這些陰謀論，你就越是沒有能力去做工程 而這是非常困難的工程，要有效地部署核武器 所以這是一個充滿希望的信息，這個世界上的破壞者在他們的世界觀下是無能的，無法創造最終的毀滅 我不同意 我不同意 哦，孩子，我不同意 那麼，爲什麼我們還在這裏？ 爲什麼我們沒有毀滅自己？ 爲什麼恐怖分子沒有打擊我們？ 幾十年了，爲什麼我們沒有毀滅自己？問題是所有這些方程式的問題 是貝特朗-羅素，對，那個哲學家說的 他說，期望一個人在鋼絲上走50年是不合理的 我是說，問題是這是一個漫長的遊戲 直到最近 你說30年前 世界上的核武器都是被嚴格控制的 那是蘇聯解體後的真正危險之一 記得嗎? 擔心突然間你會有破產的前蘇聯共和國向恐怖分子出售核武器什麼的 我建議，還有一個問題是，當我們稱這些恐怖分子爲惡魔時，對於一個美國人來說，很容易說奧薩馬-本-拉登是惡魔，對於我來說，很容易這麼說，但俗話說，一個人的恐怖分子是另一個人的自由戰士，對於其他人來說，他不是。我們稱他爲邪惡的天才 劫持飛機並把飛機開進大樓的想法，他能做到這一點，這仍然讓我摸不着頭腦，我仍然很有趣，我仍然被這個想法驚呆了，但我你知道這個想法，這是最有趣的部分，我不，我猶豫不決，因爲我不想談論這個問題。但你不需要核武器就能造成令人難以置信的嚴重危險 是的 我是說一罐汽油和一個打火機就能在合適的地方和合適的時間一次又一次地造成社會的崩潰 這就是一個國家穩定的重要性背後的論點 因此，當我們進入並幹掉薩達姆-侯賽因時，一些人提出了一個很好的反駁，他們說這是一件非常愚蠢的事情，薩達姆-侯賽因是該地區最大的反恐武器，因爲他們對他構成了威脅，所以他採取了這種方式，而且他採取的方式比我們更有壓迫性，這就是關於我們爲什麼支持嗯... 這就是爲什麼我們支持右翼國家的老話，因爲他們要幹掉那些如果不幹掉就必然會給我們帶來麻煩的人，而且他們能夠以我們永遠無法做到的方式做到這一點，據說我們很擅長這些東西，你知道，就像蘇聯是在幕後，在雷達之下，但強大而有力的中央領導所創造的穩定，讓他們幾乎是外包的反 恐怖活動讓他們出於自己的原因 我的意思是你在敘利亞的情況下看到了同樣的事情 我的意思是你不能在那個地區有一個ISIS，因爲那是對阿薩德政府的威脅，他們會幫你解決這個問題，然後這有助於我們沒有一個ISIS 所以我建議，一個遊戲仍然是在這些人是否得到核武器 呃在他們手中 我建議他們不需要他們來實現他們的目標真的 瘋狂的是，如果你開始像蝙蝠俠裏的小丑那樣思考 恐怖分子的想法，很有趣，我想我會是一個偉大的恐怖分子 因爲我充滿了這些想法 哦，你可以這樣做，想想我們是多麼的脆弱，這很可怕 但整個問題是，你作爲小丑不會做恐怖行動 這就是那個理論，對我和我父親來說很有希望 是所有的想法 你產生好想法的能力，忘記核武器
你怎麼能破壞電網 你怎麼能破壞攻擊我們的心理 嗯，攻擊就像你說的用一罐汽油，以某種方式破壞美國的系統這樣的想法，想出好的想法，我們說邪惡的人不能想出邪惡的天才想法，這就是我說的，我們有這個 我不認爲歷史能證明這一點 我的意思是，你可以說核武器能證明這一點，但只是因爲它們是最近纔出現的 是的，但我的意思是，邪惡的天才 我的意思是，這幾乎是一個諺語，但這沒關係，所以要推回它的樂趣或我不，我不是故意的 我不想讓你帶着糟糕的心情離開這裏。我不想讓你帶着糟糕的心情離開這裏，因爲我對每一個有希望的想法都會反擊，但我傾向於對這些東西有點憤世嫉俗，但這涉及到邪惡的定義，我認爲，因爲我不太確定人類歷史上有很多邪惡的人是有能力的，我相信他們大多喜歡爲了善於做一些可能被認爲是邪惡的事情。你必須能夠構建一種意識形態，當你自己照鏡子的時候，你會真正相信你是在爲這個世界做善事 而要構建一種意識形態是很難的，因爲破壞數百萬人的生活或者破壞美國的制度，我已經在自相矛盾了 我已經在自相矛盾了 我想說的是人們已經這麼做了 是的，所以我，但是... ...然後是關於外星人的問題... ...呃，如果外星人都在那裏... ...爲什麼他們沒有拜訪我們？你的說法是，從歷史背景來看，遊戲仍在繼續，只是在幾年前我們找到了毀滅自己的工具，而我們現代的挑戰之一是，我們不經常思考這種大流行病，揭示了我們在深度依賴系統方面變得多麼軟弱。所以有人跟我說 如果停電一天會怎麼樣 如果停電一個月會怎麼樣 比如說提到這個的人是伯克利大學的一個教師 他是一個天文學家 他在觀察太陽耀斑 一個太陽耀斑是很有可能的 它們總是在不同程度上發生 我有你的手機 是的，可以讓電網停電幾個月 所以你知道，只是作爲一個思想實驗 如果這個國家停電一個星期會怎麼樣 這就像E和電磁磁脈衝和核武器一樣 是的，但也許那是一種自然行爲 是的，即使只是自然行爲，也會暴露出一些脆弱的一面 脆弱的一面，然後邪惡就會出現 我是說，停電時可能發生的事情，尤其是在分裂時期 你就沒有食物了 那就意味着整個供應鏈開始崩潰 然後你就會感到絕望 絕望爲一切打開了大門 可以提出一個黑暗的問題 相對於我們一直在談論的其他事情 總會有一個線索 一個充滿希望的信息 我想 這也將是一個充滿希望的信息 你可能猜錯了 如果你要在人類文明自我毀滅的方式上賭一把 或者以某種方式崩潰 那結果將是我們無法識別的類似於進步的東西 你會說是核武器嗎？是通過更傳統的戰爭造成的社會崩潰，還是人爲的大流行病，納米技術，還是人工智能，還是我們現在還無法預料的東西，你對我們人類將如何毀滅自己，還是我們可能永遠活着，有什麼看法？我們有能力將自己的注意力集中在一起，這讓我可以選擇看待這個問題，並說我們做X和Y的幾率有多大，所以去看看62年的古巴導彈危機，在那裏我們看到了核戰爭的可能性，我們直面這個問題，我認爲這就是 我認爲那是一個充滿希望的時刻 那是我們歷史上少有的一次 我認爲核戰爭的可能性是壓倒性的 我不是一個超級肯尼迪崇拜者 崇拜，我從來不是那個人，但我要說的是，約翰-F-肯尼迪自己 嗯，可能做出了決定，拯救了一億或更多的生命，因爲他周圍的人都認爲他應該採取的道路，將導致這些死亡和反擊，是當你看看它現在我 我的意思是說，如果你是一個賭徒，你會對它下注，這是很罕見的，所以當我們談論世界將如何結束的時候，嗯，事實上，一個人實際上有他們的手，意味着這不是一個集體的決定，記得我說過，我相信人們在個人的層面上，但當我們聚集在一起時，我們更像一個人。但當我們聚集在一起時，我們更像一羣人，我們會退化到最低限度的共同標準，這是一個人的更高的道德觀念可以發揮作用，並作出決定，影響事件的發生，但當我們必須集體行動時，我變得更加悲觀，所以採取 我們對地球所做的一切，我們現在總是從氣候變化的角度來談論它，我認爲這太狹隘了，你知道，我總是感到非常沮喪，當我們談論這些爭論時，它是否正在發生，它是否是人類的，只是看一下垃圾，忘記忘記攀登它一下，我們正在 我們正在摧毀這個星球，因爲我們沒有照顧它，因爲照顧它需要集體的犧牲，需要我們有足夠的人說好，我們不能讓我們有足夠的人說好，因爲有太多的人要加入，這不是約翰-F-肯尼迪的一個決定。不是約翰-F-肯尼迪一個人的決定 我們必須要有85%的人或者全世界的人，而不僅僅是你不能說我們要停止在美國這裏對世界的破壞，如果中國做得好的話，所以必須要有大量的人加入到這個行列中來，這是很難的，你會悲觀地希望有這樣的轉變。除非它是正確的 你知道氪星要爆炸了 我們有 所以我想如果你在談論一個賭徒的觀點 那一定是賠率最高的 因爲它需要這樣一個整體 我的意思是系統也許還沒有到位 我們需要 政府間機構現在已經完全失去信譽了 你必須顛覆民族國家的利益 我是說在短時間內要做的事情太多了 我們沒有600年的時間來解決這個問題 對吧 所以對我來說這看起來是最可能的 因爲我們要避免的事情似乎是最不可能的，這有意義嗎？ 是的，絕對有意義，我相信，就像你說的個人，我相信有魅力的領導人，個人領導人會拯救我們，就像這樣，如果你不能同時得到他們，如果你在一個國家得到一個有魅力的領導人呢？如果你在一個國家得到一個有魅力的領導人，但在另一個國家得到一個有魅力的領導人，但這並不重要，這是一個漣漪效應，所以它從一個領導人開始，他們的魅力激發了其他領導人，就像一個蟻后站起來，然後其他螞蟻開始行動 我傾向於相信，當你給系統加熱，[__]開始變得非常混亂時，無論我們開發的集體智慧是什麼，領導者都會出現。你認爲是否有同樣的機會，領導者會出現，說猶太人是做這一切的人 你知道我說的是，他們會出現的想法 你有一個有魅力的領導者，他將會提出權利，或者她將會提出正確的解決方案 我的意思是，我想說的是，你可能是對的，但很多事情必須以正確的方式進行，但我對導致人類智慧和意識在地球上產生的進化過程的直覺是，像這樣的力量。如果我們把它看作是系統中的愛與系統中的恨的對比，那麼愛就更大，系統中人類的仁慈潛力就比人類的仇恨潛力大，因此，在需要的時候，激發愛和仁慈的領袖就更有可能出現，就會有更多的機會。所以你有世界上的希特勒出現，但他們實際上在歷史的大計劃中並沒有那麼大的影響，所以說起來很奇怪，但沒有那麼多人死於二戰，如果你看一下人類歷史的全部範圍，你知道是呃 高達一億，不管是什麼，還有自然大流行病 你可以有這些數字，但它仍然是一個百分比 我忘了百分比是多少，也許是地球上人類人口的百分之三點五 也許它有點集中在不同的地區，但它對整個人類沒有破壞性 所以我相信，當需要的時候，那些有魅力的領導人，在更廣泛的意義上爲世界做好事，比那些說殺光猶太人的人更有可能出現，但這只是你知道的，我只想了30秒，但我是說 但我的意思是... ...我們在這裏賭錢... ...賭21世紀誰會贏 我想也許... ...你把這個問題分成了太多的黑白二分法... ...一邊是愛和善，一邊是惡 讓我拋出一些可能更處於中心的東西... 利益可能是好的，也可能不是，好的版本我們稱之爲開明的自我利益，壞的版本我們稱之爲自私，但對我來說，自我利益似乎比一方的愛或另一方的惡更有可能影響結果，只是一個什麼對我有利或什麼對我的國家有利的問題。
對我的國家有好處 或者從我的角度看有好處 或者對我的生意有好處 如果你告訴我 也許我是一個煤礦工人 或者我擁有一個煤礦 如果你對我說我們必須停止使用煤炭 因爲它在傷害地球 我很難把這個更偉大的問題分開 所以我想，我想也許這將是一個比善惡更平凡的問題，更多的是我們不會在同一時間決定我們的利益是否一致，這有意義嗎？我的意思是，我看過Ayn Rand和客觀主義，我想當每個人都自私自利時，事情會變得多壞或多好 我想我們只是在談論兩隻拿着麥克風的螞蟻，談論兩秒鐘，但問題是，當他們傳播時，什麼是什麼？我說的愛和仁慈是指人類在地球上和整個宇宙中的繁榮，我覺得任何驅動人類的引擎都更有可能導致人類的繁榮，像希特勒這樣的人對人類的繁榮沒有好處，所以這就是我所說的好是指他們是有一個 我的意思是，也許這是一種直覺，善良是一種進化的優勢 我討厭這些術語，我討厭把東西歸結爲進化生物學，但它似乎只是爲了讓我們在整個宇宙中繁殖，對彼此友善是好的，那些領導人總是會出現，把我們從 那些想用噴火器燒燬一切的世界殺手們 這就是直覺 但讓我們來談談你 你多次提到進化論 讓我來玩玩這個 嗯 我想回到動物時代 我們被調教來處理壓倒性的威脅 就在我們面前，所以我對人類有相當大的信心，當涉及到即將到來的厄運時，就在我們的門外 呃，如果氪星即將爆炸，我認爲人類可以喚醒自己的偉大，將權力交給需要它的人，並願意做出犧牲，但這是什麼？但這也是我認爲污染、氣候變化、破壞環境的原因 呃... ...威脅之所以如此隱蔽，是因爲它發生得很慢... ...它違背了鬥爭和逃避的機制... ...違背了我們應對威脅的自然能力... ...就在我們面前，它需要一種 雖然有些人可以接受，但大多數人太擔心了，而且可以理解，我認爲太擔心今天的威脅，而不是下一代的威脅或任何可能的威脅，所以我的意思是，當我們談論當你說你認爲最大的威脅是什麼？我認爲核武器是最大的威脅 我認爲我們可以進行一場核戰爭 我們完全可以 但我認爲有足夠的慣性 我們反對這樣做 因爲人們本能地理解 如果我決定對中國發動攻擊 而我是印度 而如果你說我們會在三代人後有一整個星球的人死亡 如果我們現在不開始的話 我想我們進化的方式也許會減輕這種情況 換句話說 我想如果我們能做到這一點我會很驚喜的 這有意義嗎？我不是說要像我一樣，我是編劇的厄運，這樣很有趣 我覺得我們都是 呃，也許我在左派上比較誇張，也許我在厄運上比較誇張，所以這讓我們的聊天很有趣 我覺得有一個人，我和他聊過幾次，他慢慢成爲了我的朋友 一個叫Elon Musk的人 他是鐵桿歷史的忠實粉絲 特別是成吉思汗系列劇集 但其實所有的劇集 他和他的女朋友Grimes都在聽 我知道你喜歡什麼 是的，你知道Elon 好吧，真棒 所以這就像感情的目標 呃，就像聽鐵桿歷史一樣 週末的時候和你的愛人一起聽 好吧，如果我從人類歷史的角度去看這個人的話 感覺他就像一個小斑點，被人記住了 哦，當然，你想想看，我們這個時代的人，我們會記住什麼呢？無論是希特勒還是埃因斯坦，誰會被記住呢？ 當你身處其中時很難預測，但似乎埃隆會是被記住的人之一，如果讓我猜測他被記住的原因，那就是他在Spacex所做的工作，並有可能成爲我們不知道的人，但成爲 是他開啓了太空探索的新時代 如果我們從現在開始看，你知道幾個世紀後 如果我們作爲人類成功地存活了足夠長的時間，去冒險進入你知道的10月的星星，問你這個問題很奇怪，我不知道你的意見是什麼，但你認爲人類會成爲一個多 你認爲在歷史的長河中，人類會成爲一個多星球的物種嗎？ 你認爲Elon會成功實現他的夢想嗎？ 他並不避諱這樣說，他真的希望我們先殖民火星，然後再殖民其他地球 在整個銀河系的其他太陽系中的行星 你是否有希望我們人類能夠冒險走向星空？ 所以事情是這樣的，這實際上又和我們之前說的相吻合 我實際上首先參觀了Spacex，它是當你 你很難讓你的頭腦清醒，因爲他正在做以前政府要做的事情 是的，好的，所以我們看到個別公司和東西在做這些事情，是不可思議的，更快和更便宜 是的，而且和推動了 我的意思是，有很多人認爲Elon被高估了，當你去看的時候，你根本不知道，但這並不是我印象最深的地方。 我不想把話說到埃隆的嘴裏，所以你可以和他談談，如果你想的話，但在我看來，他所做的是認識到這個問題，而不是製造一輛汽車，這是一個垃圾，但你知道它對環境有好處，所以你應該駕駛它，他試圖創造一輛汽車，如果你只是出於自我利益的動機，你還是會買它。 他試圖創造一種汽車，如果你只是出於自我利益，你還是會買它，它將有助於環境，幫助我們擺脫損害的主要原因之一。 我的意思是，這次大流行病和世界各地的關閉所做的事情之一是向我們展示地球實際上可以恢復活力的驚人速度。如果只是一個主要的污染源，我們沒有汽車造成的污染，對嗎？如果你在10年前對我說，丹，你認爲我們過渡到遠離汽車的幾率有多大？ 如果你是一個自我導向的消費者，你就會買它，因爲你想要那輛車，這是解決人們不願意的問題的最好辦法，我想他已經發現了這一點，正如他以前告訴我的那樣，你知道上一次創建一個汽車公司是什麼時候，你知道等等等等，他是對的，所以我碰巧覺得，儘管他在空間問題上推波助瀾，我想其他人也會這樣做的 我不確定，因爲他提到的各種事情，啓動是多麼困難，我不確定爲我們創造車輛的行業會走到他要領導的地方，如果他不通過消費者的需求迫使他們走到那裏，製造更好的汽車，人們想要它，無論如何，他們會跟隨，他們會複製，他們會做所有這些事情，然而誰會做呢？所以我希望他不要因爲我這麼說而討厭我，但我碰巧認爲特斯拉的想法可能會減輕一些離開這個星球的需要，因爲這個星球正在被摧毀，如果我們活得夠久，我們可能會去殖民火星，我認爲特斯拉的想法不僅僅是埃隆的版本，還有其他人的版本，是確保我們能活得夠久的最好機會。我們有足夠長的時間看到火星被殖民，這有意義嗎？ 是的，完全有意義，從我的角度來看，還有一件事，因爲我現在正在創辦一家公司，我認爲埃隆的有趣之處在於，他是一個希望的燈塔，就像務實地說，人們對我們先前的厄運談話進行了反駁，一個人可以建立一些東西，讓我們作爲自我感興趣的個人聚集在一起 有興趣的個人以一種集體的方式聚集在一起，實際減輕我們的世界所面臨的一些危險，因此，作爲一個人，它給我帶來了希望，我可以建立一些實際有影響的東西，以抵消呃，斯坦林和希特勒和所有人類文明面臨的威脅，個人有這種力量，我我不相信個人在政府大廳裏有這種力量，比如我不覺得任何一個總統候選人可以站起來，幫助世界團結起來，它感覺從 從我所看到的一切來看，你對特斯拉的看法是正確的，它可以讓世界團結起來做好事，這是一個非常強大的機制，你知道不管你怎麼說資本主義，你可以建立公司，從一個人開始，當然，有一個集體，圍繞着它成長，但一個人的領導力，他們的想法，他們的夢想，他們的願景可以催化一些東西，接管世界，爲整個世界做好事，但如果我認爲，但再次我認爲這個想法的天才是，它不要求我們去頭 他實際上是把人類的天性融入到了這個想法中，他說我不要求你成爲一個環保主義者，我不要求你犧牲，讓我賣給你一輛你會更喜歡的車，通過購買它，你會幫助環境，考慮到我們作爲一個物種的弱點。
考慮到我們作爲一個物種的缺陷，並實際利用它來爲更大的利益工作，這就是那種讓我的小厄運驅逐者憤世嫉俗的事情，因爲你實際上是在打擊我們的生活，對嗎？ 你是你是你不是你可以把某人誰甚至不相信環境 你不相信環境是個問題，但他們想要特斯拉，所以他們無意中幫助了我們 我認爲這是一個天才的想法 是的，我告訴你，這是一個讓愛更有效的變革機制的方法 這就是爲什麼他是對的，我是對的 這就是爲什麼Elon說愛就是答案，我想這正是他的意思 好吧，讓我們嘗試一下困難的事情 你在你的常識節目中錄製了一集《駛向冰山》 是的，這開始了很多對話，很感人，讓我很糾結。很多憤怒的郵件 當然，我做了一件我30年都沒做過的事，我支持兩個主要政黨之一的政治候選人，有很多人因此而感到失望 我想我沒有把它當作一種支持，我只是把它當作一種類似於你在鐵桿歷史中的對話，幾乎是用你談論歷史時的聲音來談論現代，所以它只是對今天的世界有一點困擾的看法 我知道我們剛剛穿上了我們的厄運，厄運，讓我把它放回去，你沒有，我喜歡厄運製造者這個詞 嗯，是的，是的 嗯，我們如何讓愛獲勝，有什麼出路呢？ 有一些希望的線，我們可以走，嗯，以避免一些 我討厭使用術語，但看起來像內戰的東西 不一定是武力的戰爭 但分裂到一個水平，它不再感覺像一個美利堅合衆國的聯合國家，強調團結 我讀過一本書，好像是喬治-弗裏德曼寫的，叫《未來一百年》，我記得我不同意這本書的任何內容，我想他在書中說的一件事是，你知道美國要解體了，我憑記憶，他可能根本沒說過，但我記得有些東西停留在我的記憶中，我記得我在想，但我認爲有些論點與我們的分歧有關。我認爲一些論點與我們的差異有關，而這些差異正在被利用，所以我們早些時候談到了媒體，在缺乏真相和一切的情況下，我們有一個媒體環境，被激勵在我們的社會中採取楔子，使他們更廣泛，沒有反作用力，做相反的或幫助你知道，所以嗯有一個著名的嗯備忘錄從一個團體稱爲項目爲一個新的美國世紀，他們把它下來，但方式回到機在線仍然有它 它發生在9月11日之前，引發了各種陰謀論，因爲它說的大意是，我真的在這裏轉述，但你知道，美國需要另一個珍珠港式的事件，因爲這些事件激發了一個國家，如果沒有這些事件，週期性地自然傾向於自我分裂，正是這些週期性的事件，作爲反作用力，否則是不存在的 嗯，如果這是真的，我們自然傾向於走向 如果這是真的，那麼我們就會自然而然地傾向於把自己拉開，所以要有一個媒體環境，靠擴大這些分歧來賺錢，而我們就是這樣做的 我是說我在脫口秀電臺，它有那些人，那些曾經對我大喊大叫的人，因爲我不會這樣做，但我是說我們會在每次廣播後有這些可怕的談話，我在那裏和節目主管一起，他們對我大喊大叫，說熱是值得創造更多的熱 什麼是熱，熱就是分歧，他們想要熱 不是因爲他們是政治家，他們也不是共和黨人或民主黨人，他們是我們要聽衆，我們要參與和投入，由於格式的構造，你沒有很多時間來獲得它，所以你不能讓我給你像在播客中一個半小時或兩個小時，我們建立一個邏輯論證，你和我在一起的整個過程中，你的聽衆每15分鐘都在變化，所以無論你提出什麼觀點來創造興趣和好奇和參與必須是膝蓋 他們曾經告訴我，觀衆必須在打開節目的五分鐘內知道你在每個問題上的立場，換句話說，你必須是一套線性的政治信仰的一部分，如果你對主題A有感覺，那麼你對主題D一定有感覺，而我甚至不需要聽你說。我甚至不需要聽你的意見，因爲如果你對A有這樣的感覺，你就會對D有這樣的感覺，這是一個爲了利潤而設計的系統，但不是因爲他們想把我們拉開，這是先知的副產品，這是我們社會中50個例子中的一個小例子。這只是我們社會中50個例子中的一個例子 所以美國新世紀計劃的文件是這樣說的：我們自然而然地傾向於不團結，如果沒有一些東西偶爾把團結的力量拉回來，這樣我們就可以從基線開始，然後把自己拉開，直到下一個珍珠港的出現 我想這就是喬治-弗裏德曼的書中所說的 我當時很不同意的觀點 所以在回答你關於內戰的問題時 因爲我們沒有像以前那樣明確的地理劃分，你有一個基本的南北線和一些邊境州。 現在，我們在社區和家庭中分裂，在選區和選區中分裂，所以你不能脫離，我們彼此困在一起，所以如果現在有一場內戰，由於缺乏一個更好的詞，它可能看起來像20世紀60年代末和70年代初的情況。20世紀70年代初的爆炸事件，我們稱之爲國內恐怖主義之類的東西，因爲這似乎又是一個你甚至不需要大塊的國家分裂的東西 10%的人認爲這是末世，就可以造成傷害，就像我們之前談到的恐怖主義一樣 一罐汽油和一個大打火機 我住過很多地方，我不會告訴任何人 一罐汽油和一個打火機就能在你眨眼之前炸掉上千座房子 是的 恐怖分子不一定來自中東 也不一定有什麼原教旨主義的宗教目的 可能只是某個對選舉結果非常生氣的人 所以再一次，如果我們在這裏玩一個賠率遊戲，每個人都必須表現得很好，只有少數人表現不好，這件事纔會出問題，記住，每一個行動都有一個相等的相反的反應，所以你甚至不需要讓那些人 所以你甚至不需要那些人做所有這些事情 他們要做的就是開始報復循環，然後就會升級 是的，它就會形成自己的勢頭，這從根本上導致 如果你沿着事件鏈往下走，就會形成某種形式的獨裁政府，這是創造穩定的唯一方法 獨裁者就是這樣做的 與德國納粹有相似之處 焚燒國會大廈，你知道的，等等等等 我又是厄運的製造者 好吧，其中一些可能是由那些尋求獨裁權力的人制造的 就像國會大廈的大火，或者是1939年波蘭士兵越境開火 在1939年的入侵之前 呃，爲了對抗 呃，魔鬼的代言人是天使的代言人 呃，我想說就像我們關於Elon的談話一樣 感覺個人有力量讓我們團結起來，成爲團結的力量 所以呃，你提到了媒體 我想你是歷史上最偉大的播客之一 Joe Rogan是一個像長條形的 不管它是什麼，它不是播客，它實際上是什麼，它是非常不頻繁的，不管它是什麼，但它的基本過程是你深入，你保持深入，聽衆與你保持很長一段時間，所以我我只是在看數字，就像我們幾乎三個小時，我從以前的節目中，我可以告訴你，大約 30萬人還在聽我們的聲音，三個小時後，通常有30到50萬人在聽，他們也祝賀你，順便說一下，喬-羅根是這個數字的10倍，所以他有團結的力量，呃，你有團結的力量，有幾個人的聲音，感覺他們有團結的力量 團結起來，即使你如果你引用了一個候選人的名字，等等，在我看來，說到我不想一直說愛，但這是愛，也許是團結，更實際地說，像理智，像尊重那些你不同意或不理解的人，呃，所以同情心，好吧，只要有幾個這樣的聲音，可以幫助我們避免真正重要的不是 幫助我們避免真正重要的不是避免單一的事件，就像你說的有人放火之類的，而是避免它的升級，民衆準備把這些事件升級爲 是的，把單一的事件變成單一的暴亂或槍擊，甚至比這更戲劇性的事情，把它變成 我想把責任放在像你和我這樣的人身上，在某種程度上，喬認識到很多非常具有破壞性的事情可能在11月發生，而一些聲音可以拯救我們，這是我的感覺。不是說我們應該投票給誰或者其他什麼東西，而是真正成爲平靜的聲音，讓大海平靜下來，或者不管用什麼比喻，不讓它沸騰起來，因爲我真的很擔心，這是今年第一次，我有時會覺得美國的項目會一直持續下去 當我來到這個國家的時候，我只是相信，我想我還很年輕，但就像你知道的那樣，我有一個夢想，就是創建一個公司，爲世界做很多好事，我認爲美國是世界希望的燈塔，有自由的想法，也有授權公司的想法，可以爲世界做一些好事，我只是 我很擔心這個美國，它讓我這個來自我們家庭的孩子從一無所有的地方來，從你知道的俄羅斯，因爲它是蘇聯，因爲它是能夠在這個新的國家做任何事情的，我只是擔心它，感覺有幾個人仍然可以讓這個項目繼續下去，像埃隆，像喬這樣的人，呃，有嗎？你有一點希望嗎？ 我現在正在看這個社交媒體的實驗，我甚至不是指社交媒體，而是把它擴展到 嗯，我的意思是，我覺得我們現在都是小白鼠，看着你知道我有兩個孩子，只是看着，他們兩個人之間有三年的差距，一個18歲，另一個15歲。
當我還是個孩子的時候，一個18歲的人和一個15歲的人並沒有什麼不同，只是在成熟度上相差了三年，但是他們的生活經歷，你會很容易把這兩個人歸類爲同一代人，現在因爲技術變革的速度，我的18歲和我的15歲之間有很大的不同，不是成熟度的問題，只是在他們使用什麼應用程序，他們如何與對方交往，如何與他們的同伴相處，呃，他們的社交技能，所有這些事情，你轉過身去，這是未知的領域我們從來沒有去過這裏 所以，看看這對社會有什麼影響是很有趣的，因爲這與你的問題有關 最令人不安的是，在網上看到人們是如何對待對方的，你知道有很多關於這個問題的理論，有些只是爲了嘲弄人，笑一笑 有些是人們沒有面對面的交流，所以他們覺得可以自由地以這種方式對待對方 嗯，當然，我想弄清楚，如果這就是我們一直以來的人生態度，那麼我們一直都是這樣的，但我們從來沒有辦法公開發表我們的感受 還是說環境和社交媒體以及其他一切都帶來了變化，把我們變成了另一種人 不管是哪種情況，當人們讀到我們如何對待彼此，以及我們在網上說的那些可怕的事情，這似乎不應該是什麼大問題，它們只是文字而已 但它們有一個累積效應 我的意思是，當你... ...我在讀... ...Meghan Markle，我對她瞭解不多，因爲它是... ...太多流行文化的一面，我無法支付，但我有一天讀到一個故事，她談到了她在網上受到的虐待，有多麼令人難以置信的壓倒性。有多少人在這樣做，你對自己說，好吧，這是那些處於你之前討論的位置的人從來沒有處理過的事情，讓我問你一些事情，孩子，這是所有時間的終極厄運的事情，當你想到那些推動愛、和平、嗯和創造敵人之間的橋樑的歷史人物時，你想到那些人是如何發生的，首先，他們非常危險，世界上的每個社會在處理暴力和類似事情時都比他們更容易。 暴力非 例如，甘地、耶穌和馬丁-路德-金的遭遇，你想想那些人，當他們在那一天，很諷刺的是，這些推動和平解決方案的人經常被殺，但這是因爲他們是有效的，當他們被殺時，效力就會降低。當他們被殺的時候，效果就會減弱 爲什麼他們會被殺，因爲他們很有效 唯一能阻止他們的方法就是消滅他們 因爲他們是有魅力的領袖，不是每天都有的 如果你把他們從舞臺上消滅了，你就有可能在一段時間內找不到另一個人 我想我要說的是你所說的這些事情 會產生你認爲的效果 他們會以一種我們大多數人認爲是積極的方式來破壞系統的穩定 但這些系統有辦法保護自己，所以我覺得歷史表明 歷史是相當悲觀的 我想總的來說 但我覺得那些對事物發展有危險的人往往會被清除掉 是的，但有兩點可以說，我覺得你是對的，歷史 我覺得愛在歷史上留下的漣漪不那麼明顯，可以察覺到，但實際上更有變革性 就像人們可以說，如果你想談論耶穌的長期價值 如果你想談談耶穌和甘地的長期價值 是的，這些人的漣漪至今仍在影響着人們 我同意，你可以通過我們看到的生活質量的普遍提高來感受到這些漣漪，在各個時代，你可以感受到這些漣漪 我同意你的說法 好吧，但我認爲即使這不是真的，我也傾向於相信這一點，順便說一下，我正在工作的公司是一個競爭對手，正是在攻擊這個，它是twitter的競爭對手，我認爲我可以建立一個更好的twitter，作爲第一步，這裏面有一個更長的故事，我認爲一個三歲的孩子可以建立更好的twitter。 我認爲一個三歲的孩子也可以做得更好，這不是在詆譭你，我相信你的孩子會比一個三歲的孩子做得更好，但是twitter是這樣的，聽facebook說他們是非常糟糕的智力討論和有意義的討論的平臺，但是我在上面，所以讓我說我是問題的一部分，我們是新的，所以它不是，在當時不是很明顯，怎麼做，現在你同意，現在一個三歲的孩子可以做。 我傾向於相信，我們生活在這樣一個時代，對提供愛感興趣的人的工具，比如愛的武器，要強大得多，所以像技術的一個好處是，它允許任何人建立一個比任何政府更強大的公司，所以這可能是非常有破壞性的，但也可能是非常積極的 我傾向於相信，像Elon這樣的人，想爲世界做貢獻的人，像我這樣的人，還有很多像我這樣的人，可以比任何一個政府擁有更多的權力。 我說的權力是指影響變化的權力，這與政府的權力不同。但我的意思是，你如何處理這樣一個事實，即那些害怕這個的政府已經把他們自己的互聯網系統隔離開來，作爲一種建立防火牆的方式，僅僅是爲了防止你做你正在談論的事情，換句話說，如果有一條老線，如果投票真的改變了什麼，他們永遠不會允許，如果如果愛通過一個現代 如果愛情通過現代微博的繼承者真的能做到你想做的事，這將破壞政府的穩定，你認爲政府會採取反擊措施，在愛情變得太危險之前壓制它嗎？ 有幾個答案，首先，我不認爲愛情是你先前所說的那樣是國家的敵人 不同的國家有不同的觀點 我認爲國家想要權力 我不認爲愛和權力有衝突，就像我想的那樣 我認爲這不僅僅是愛的問題，還有理性的問題 理性的問題，同情的問題 所有這些東西，我不認爲它們一定要在定義上 所以這是一種感覺 我覺得基本上你可以用木馬把愛植入到背後 但你必須擅長這個問題 你必須意識到這些國家的思維方式 所以中國禁止某些服務等等的事實 我想這不就是那首《愛情是個戰場》嗎？ 我想這都是一個貓編輯 是的，這都是一個遊戲，你必須擅長這個遊戲，就像我們說的Elon，你知道Tesla和拯救環境 我的意思是，這不只是在舞臺上說拯救環境很重要，而是通過 是通過製造一個人們不禁喜歡的產品 然後說服好萊塢明星喜歡它，就像有一個遊戲可以玩一樣 好吧，讓我再接再厲，因爲我認爲有一種方法可以看到這一點 我認爲你是對的，所以，呃，這與一個關於20世紀60年代的故事有關 在巨大的計劃中，20世紀60年代看起來像一個新浪漫主義的復興。 我有個朋友比我大好幾歲，比我大20歲，他在60年代參加了抗議活動，做了所有這些事情，我們在談論它，我把它浪漫化了，他說不要浪漫化，他說讓我告訴你，大多數人去參加那些抗議活動，做了所有這些事情 他們去那裏是爲了認識女孩，享受一段美好的時光，你知道那是... ...不是這樣的，但它變得很時髦，有... ...換句話說，讓我們談談你的同情心和愛，在我看來，你永遠不會抓住那一大羣人，他們只對他們感興趣，但如果對一個年輕的小夥子來說，認識女孩需要你假裝同情心 需要你假裝有同理心 需要你閱讀更深層次的主題 因爲那是人們喜歡的東西 你幾乎可以作爲一種愚蠢的方式來趕時髦 你可以讓同理心成爲時髦 愛情成爲時髦的解決方案 那是與之相反的 嗯，那種人們本質上不會忍受的東西 你換句話說，存在這種可能性 改變時代潮流的可能性是存在的 是的，以一種方式重新定位，即使大多數人並不認真對待它，結果也是一樣的，這是否有意義？歸根結底是爲了滿足女孩和男孩的需求 你又一次找到了進化的動機，你總是在安全的基礎上做這件事 對我來說有點困難，你知道，我相信你也很難聽我說讚美你的話，但這並不好，對我們倆來說都很困難，好嗎？所以，你知道，你和我，就像我跟你說的那樣，我認爲麥克已經做了很長時間的朋友了，這只是一種方式，所以我已經離開了，現在是雙向的，所以這就是播客的魅力，你知道，我的意思是現在只是很幸運，這個特別的播客，我看到人們的眼睛，當他們遇到我，他們已經 幾年來一直是我的朋友，在我們開始交談後，我們很快就成了朋友，是的，但這是一種方式，在獸醫的第一個時刻，呃，你知道，有一些關於你的特別硬核的歷史，呃，你知道我做一些瘋狂的挑戰和運行和東西，我記得特別可能沒有 我記得我最喜歡的一集是 "痛苦的娛樂"，有些人討厭這一集，因爲它太真實了，這是我最黑暗的一集，我們想設定一個基線，這就是基線，但我記得聽了這一集，當我跑了22英里，對我來說是很長的距離，呃，它只是把你拉進去，有一些很強大的東西
關於這個特別的創造，它比你更大，實際上你已經創造了它，這很有趣，我想任何成功的東西都是這樣的，就像Elon的東西一樣，它變得比你更大，這就是你所希望的，是的，絕對不是想打斷你，我道歉，我想有一個問題，如果你喜歡照鏡子，但你也看着我，你會給自己什麼建議？對我來說，對其他播音員來說，也許對喬-羅根來說，我們正在進行的這個旅程，我覺得它很特別，我不知道到底發生了什麼，但感覺播音很特別，你有什麼建議，我是相對較新的，你有什麼建議給那些帶着這個火焰和旅行這個旅程的人，我經常被新的播音員問到建議，人們剛剛開始，所以我有一種 所以我有一份久經考驗的清單，包括該做的和不該做的，但我對你或對喬伊沒有任何建議，喬伊不需要我提供任何建議，我是說他還沒有，他還是個迷茫的孩子，對世界充滿好奇，但這就是天才，這就是喬伊的品牌，對吧？或者說，他們不需要，他們已經想明白了。有時需要幫助的人是全新的人，他們想知道我的第一個節目該怎麼做，我怎麼和他們交談，我有標準答案，但你找到了你的利基，我的意思是你不需要我告訴你怎麼做，事實上我可能會問你關於你怎麼做的問題。就像我們在線下討論的貨幣化問題，這是一個很吸引人的問題，作爲一個獨立的人，非常困難 是的，呃，喬面臨的一個問題是 嗯，我不知道你是否在關注，但他加入了Spotify，有一個1億美元的交易，然後在他們的平臺上進行獨家的想法，這個我不給該死的錢個人，但我是單身，所以我喜歡住在一個破地方 我喜歡住在一個糟糕的地方，所以我想這讓你更容易得到自由，你知道的，自由的材料是石板，而不是爲任何人的大學儲蓄。攻擊Spotify，然後我讓自己冷靜下來，你不能把我們擁有的特殊東西鎖起來，但後來我意識到，也許這些工具只是爲了接觸更多的人，實際上更尊重播客等等，所以這就是我的意思，不清楚旅程是什麼，因爲呃你也作爲燈塔，現在有像數百萬100萬以上的播客，我我不知道旅程是什麼，你有一個感覺。嗯，你是以同樣的方式感受到了浪漫，因爲你有一個根，也有廣播，你覺得播客是盜版電臺，還是Spotify的事情是一個可能的途徑，你對喬作爲一個粉絲作爲喬的朋友感到緊張，還是這是一個對我們有好處的事情，所以我的歷史，我是如何參與播客的，是的，我是在電臺呃，然後我開始一個公司，早在時代的互聯網 我和其他六個人一起做了這個公司，公司的整個目標是，我們必須發明這個詞，我相信每個人都有其他地方在同一時間發明了這個詞，但我們向投資者推銷的東西是 這是在YouTube之前，在播客之前，在所有這些東西之前，我的工作是做佈道者，我會去找這些人談話，唱出所有業餘內容將是偉大的方式的讚美，我從來沒有得到一口，他們都告訴我同樣的事情，這是不會起飛的 因爲任何優秀的人都會在這方面賺錢，我一直在說，忘了我們在這裏談論的是規模，如果你每週有數以百萬計的內容被製作，一小部分會是好的，無論如何，16歲的孩子會知道其他16歲的孩子是什麼樣子，我一直在推動這個沒有人 如果你在1999年談論業餘內容，那麼你就已經走在了遊戲的前面，你不知道它在經濟上會發展到什麼程度，但知道它在技術上會發展到什麼程度，所以當我們在2005年開始播客時，它是一個政治性的播客。我們沒有任何財務方面的想法，我們只是想掌握技術，以及如何把它分發給人們，所有這些都是多年以後，我們試圖弄清楚，好吧，我們如何能得到足夠的錢，以支持我們做這個事情。我們和便宜和簡單的方法是隻是問聽衆捐贈像PBS樣的模式，這是，這是最初的模式嗯，然後一旦我們開始下來，我們想出了其他模式，有廣告的事情，我們賣舊的節目，所以所有這些成爲我們支持自己的方式嗯，但作爲播客 但隨着播客的成熟，隨着更多的操作系統的發展和手機的發展，以及所有這些事情，每一個這些發展實際上使人們更容易得到播客，實際上使它更復雜，以使他們的錢是的，所以當我們的觀衆正在建立的時間和努力，我們不得不把到的金額 所以回到你的Spotify問題，只用一個例子，有很多人都在做類似的事情 嗯，在這個時代，你知道我們只是賣mp3文件，你必須有一個mp3播放器，這很便宜，也很髒，現在每次有一個操作系統的升級，都會給我們帶來一些麻煩，所以我們要 我的意思是，我的選擇是在這一點上開始僱用員工，更多的員工，你知道的人，然後成爲一個人力資源經理，我的意思是，這是海盜電臺的一面，是海盜電臺的一面，因爲你不需要任何人，但你知道你或你和另一個我的意思是，你可以只做這個精簡和平均，它變得難以做 現在已經很難做到了 所以如果有人像Spotify一樣進來說 嘿，我們會幫你處理這些事情的 過去我只會說滾開，我們不需要你 我不介意，我也肯定不會在這上面賺到我們能賺到的錢 但是我們要做的事情對我來說是很光榮的，但對我來說已經變得很繁重了 總之，如果有人來跟我說，我們會幫你撿起來的 我們不會干涉你的內容，不會的 對我來說，你不能說我們需要每個月做一個節目，因爲那是不可能的 我是說每個人的設計都不一樣，所以不能一概而論 但我想作爲一個長期的海盜播客 嗯，你知道我們一直在尋找與人合作，但沒有人適合我們合作 我的意思是，所以我一直在尋找方法，把它的那一面從我的盤子裏拿出來，因爲我對那一面不感興趣 我想做的是節目和你知道，在這一點上你真的是 你不應該稱自己爲藝術家，因爲有些人... ...你知道那是要由其他人來決定的... ...但我的意思是，我們在努力做藝術，這有一些非常令人滿意的地方... ...但我不能忍受的是，越來越多的時間被貨幣化的問題所佔用... ...所以有一個理由，我想這就是我所說的 如果與外部公司合作，可以提高你的藝術能力，同時又不會削弱你的藝術能力 我想說的是，這很誘人 是的，我不喜歡大公司，所以我害怕任何可能帶來的束縛 如果我是Joe Rogan，我談論的話題可以讓公司上市，你知道有點緊張 嗯，我當然會小心，但同時，人們誰不在這個遊戲不明白的問題，從字面上 我的意思是，只是所有的操作系統 所有的podcatcher 每次一些新的podcatcher出來，使它更容易獲得播客的東西，這是東西 我們必須要考慮到後端的問題，我也不是什麼技術奇才，所以我覺得也許是這樣的，也許簡短的回答是，隨着媒體的發展，你必須要考慮的事情，不是因爲你想賣掉，而是因爲你想繼續下去，要做盜版越來越難了。 在這種環境下，讓我信服的事情，特別是在Spotify內部，他們理解，所以如果你帶着一些懷疑的態度走進這整個事情，就像你說的大公司，那麼它就會起作用，因爲Spotify理解播客的魔力，或者他們似乎在某種程度上，至少他們理解到足夠尊重喬-羅根，儘管我不知道，我不知道。我不知道，如果你 呃，所以有互聯網 和有意見的人 在互聯網上真的是 是的，他們有意見 關於喬和Spotify 但現實是有兩件事 在私人談話 與喬和一般 有兩個重要的事情 一個Spotify字面上 不告訴喬什麼 像所有的人認爲他們 Spotify的某種方式 推喬在此 所有認爲Spotify以某種方式將Joe推向這個方向的人 合同中並沒有堅持這一點，但你也知道公司有一種方式，即使有合同，我也要做你知道的營銷人員 嘿，我知道我們沒有強迫你 是的，是的，是的，我討厭這樣 是的，但和你一起跳 你和Joe是一樣的，Spotify很聰明，不會發一封那樣的郵件，這真的很聰明，他們 在Spotify內部有一些會議，就像人們讀到的人們抱怨的那樣，但這些會議從來沒有接觸到Joe，從來沒有，這就像公司的東西，Spotify的想法與盜版電臺不同，播客的困難之處在於沒有人關心你的播客，你是孤獨的，我的意思是有粉絲和東西，但沒有人
是的，關於Spotify的好處是，他們希望Joe和Joe的播客能夠更加成功，這就是Joe談到的YouTube和Spotify的區別，Spotify想成爲播客界的Netflix，他們就像Netflix一樣，他們不想以任何方式控制你，但是 他們想創建一個平臺，在那裏你可以蓬勃發展，即使你的利益是一致的利益是孤獨的，所以讓我提出讓我提出的東西，呃，讓我們做一個區分，因爲不是所有的公司誰這樣做是相同的，你提出了YouTube和Spotify，但對我來說，YouTube是至少更喜歡Spotify比一些這些 小呃這個詞是圍牆花園，對，你聽說過圍牆花園這個詞好吧，所以嗯，我一直在播客周圍這麼久，我已經看到了一輪又一輪的整合，多年來，他們來在波和所有的突然，所以你會得到呃，我不打算提任何名字，但直到最近的整合是發生與 相對較小的公司相比，像Spotify和問題是，通過決定整合你的材料在一個圍牆花園，你是牆自己從觀衆的權利嗯，所以你的選擇是我要接受這筆錢從這家公司，但損失將是我的觀衆的一大塊，這是一個捕捉 - 22，因爲你與該公司的談判能力是基於你的聽衆規模，所以與他們簽約，減少了你的聽衆規模，你失去了談判能力，但當你到了Spotify的水平，只是把他們挑出來，還有其他玩家 嗯，但你特別提到了Spotify，這些人都可以 有可能隨着時間的推移提高你的聽衆，所以對你的風險較低，因爲如果你決定在一年或兩年，無論許可協議的期限是什麼，你與他們完成，你想離開，而不是你會一直與一些較小的圍牆花園，你走了 你有可能帶着你在原始交易中得到的一小部分觀衆離開，再加上更多的觀衆，因爲他們的算法和一切都被設計成如果他們認爲你喜歡，就會把呃人推到你的內容上，所以它帶走了一些負面的風險。如果你能像喬-羅根那樣寫一份協議，我的意思是，你已經保護了你的自由，以你想要的方式發佈內容，所以，如果一些負面風險得到緩解，如果你消除了試圖賺錢的問題，跟上最新的技術，那麼它可能是值得的。我很害怕這樣的事情，但同時我也在努力避免成爲一個白癡 是的，我可以成爲一個白癡，當你像我一樣獨立做了這麼久的事情時，這種慣性就會有一種力量，但我是我是我在另一端試圖做的事情上受到了足夠的抑制 這至少讓我開始傾聽人們的聲音 是的，但同時我也愛我的聽衆 這聽起來很老套，但他們就是我在這裏的原因 所以我想確保無論我做什麼，如果我可以的話，都要與我和這些人15年來的關係保持一致，但 就像你說的，不管你做什麼，你都要去，因爲你看問題是這樣的，如果你不和那些公司簽約，讓他們更容易在這隻手上拿到你的東西，他們可能會罵你，因爲新的操作系統，新的操作系統剛剛更新，你就無法拿到你的東西。所以，無論如何，你都會讓自己受到嘲笑，在這一點上，所有這些都讓你更容易去 好吧，如果有合適的交易出現，他們沒有欺騙我，他們沒有欺騙我的觀衆，等等等等 你知道我的意思是，在這個行業，當你談論尖端技術的時候，是不斷變化的。 正如你所說的，有一百萬個播客，而且還在不斷增加 我認爲你必須努力保持靈活性，尤其是如果他們能減少下滑的風險 我認爲你必須這樣做 我認爲你是個白癡，至少要努力跟上當前的趨勢 看，我在看喬，我在想 好吧，讓我們看看如何 是的，我的意思是，如果他說："這太糟糕了，我要離開這裏。"好吧，那些人是對的，你知道，所以喬把自己當作一隻小白鼠，我和其他小白鼠都很感激，作爲你們節目的粉絲，作爲Netflix的粉絲，我想我可以代表成千上萬的人說，希望你們的節目能給他們帶來好處。我想我可以代表幾百萬人說，希望硬核歷史來到Netflix，或者如果Spotify成爲播客的Netflix，進入Spotify，有一些東西是最好的，他們把你說的藝術家帶出來，所以我可以說是他們把最好的藝術家帶出來，他們把一些令人頭痛的東西去掉。比如說Netflix就能在你的作品中找到美感和力量，甚至比你做的更好 他們不干涉創作，但他們也有自己的品牌，可能太過干涉了，那就不對了 對我來說，這是對的，絕對不能幫助，但這就是爲什麼Netflix是大師級的，他們似乎不干涉人才，而不是我可以把其他人扔到公共汽車下，就像有很多地方可以扔到公共汽車下，絕對的，所以我很喜歡，我知道現在可能有人在叫好，呃，就在 我不喜歡問這個問題，但它可能是最受歡迎的問題，無法回答，所以讓我試着用你會回答的方式來問它，當然，你說你不經常發佈節目，呃，問題是要求和問題是你能做什麼？你能告訴丹做一個關於內戰的節目嗎？ 你能告訴丹做一個關於拿破崙-波拿巴的節目嗎？ 你能告訴他們做一個嗎？ 你知道每一個話題，你已經說過了，實際上你關於內戰的答案很有意思，我不知道你知道我的答案是什麼，但是內戰是你不喜歡的，你作爲一個軍事歷史學家，你喜歡在 特別是當軍隊之間存在差異的時候... ...就像內戰一樣... ...當我聽到你說的時候，我大喫一驚... ...你知道它沒有一個有趣的... ...兩個對立面之間複雜的對比，就像羅馬內戰中軍團對軍團一樣... ...是的，你也說過，你的那種節目... 你也說過你的節目是你對那個時期有一些基本的瞭解，所以當你在一個節目中工作的時候，基本上就像在進一步拉動那些弦，就像刷新你的思想和學習，肯定做了研究。在Reddit上有一些想法，就像在你的腦海中徘徊，關於未來可能的劇集，是否有一些東西，無論你呃不承諾什麼，但呃無論你是否要做它，是否有一些東西，就像讓你覺得嗯，這將是有趣的，呃，拉在那條線一點點哦，是的，我我我們有 我們把一些東西放在口袋裏，以備不時之需 所以，"末日藍圖 "是我們做的第一個世界大戰系列，一直都在我的口袋裏 當戰爭的百年紀念日到來的時候，似乎是一個很好的時機，可以把它拿出來 那是一個地獄般的系列，可能是我的最愛之一，我的後背，我必須告訴你 從心理學上講，你知道，當你看到這些的時候，我想我是在猜測，我想這是26個小時，所有的作品都在一起，想想看，我們沒有劇本，是即興創作的 是的，所以想想看，20個小時 我昨天有人在微博上寫道，他說，我沒有看到你的奉獻，你只有2. 我想說，夥計，你不知道只有其他歷史播客才真正瞭解，即使他們一般也不會做26小時。 我說過，我們做的第一個節目是15分鐘，我可以一個月做一個，但當你在做的時候，我的意思是，我們做的最後一個節目是羅馬共和國的衰落，是5個半小時，那是一本書，對吧，那是第六部分。所以我的意思是，你只是做了一個計算 嗯，這感覺就像你很興奮地中斷 而在第一次世界大戰中，感覺你是在情感上被拉進了它，就像它感覺很累 我想說這是否是一件好事，因爲你知道，我認爲我們在節目中說， 是當時人們的感覺，我想有一次我們說，如果這開始似乎是殘酷的重複，現在你知道當時人們的感覺，所以換句話說，有任何一種無意的，因爲當你即興表演時，其中一些東西是無意的 但它無意中創造了正確的氛圍，使人們對故事情節產生共鳴，對我來說，這些都是偶然的時刻，使這一藝術成爲藝術，而不是某種按部就班的努力，你知道嗎？我認爲，如果我們把劇本寫出來，就不會發生這樣的事情，所以主要是你把知識的工具帶到桌子上，然後在很大程度上即興創作，比如實際的措辭，我總是說我們把它做得像他們做的事情一樣，比如脊髓穿刺和一些其他的事情，嗯 所以，我確實有關於一些事情的筆記，比如在這本書的第427頁，你有這句話，這樣我就知道，我已經到了可以把這句話放進去的地步了，有時我會寫下筆記，說這是你昨天離開的地方，這樣我就記住了。但在即興創作中，你會扔掉很多東西，所以... ...就像... ...但它允許我們在切線上走，比如我們會嘗試一些東西，比如我坐在那裏，想知道這聽起來像什麼，我會花兩天時間走這條路，然後我聽他說，這不起作用，但這就是你 但這就是作家們經常做的事，這叫殺死你的孩子，對嗎？ 你不能這樣做，你知道不能這樣做，但人們會這樣做，所以這傢伙說我沒有看到奉獻，他不知道有多少東西被扔掉了。
大約兩個月前，我聽了這個節目，我就說，你知道嗎，這是不對的，嘣，六個星期的工作就這麼沒了 是的，但問題就在這裏，你相信你的判斷，你很抱歉打斷了你的判斷，不，呃，但這裏是這樣的，這裏是這樣的 我們的節目有點不同 我們的節目和別人的有點不一樣 喬-羅根稱之爲常青內容 換句話說 我的政治節目就像你買的一輛車 你一開走它就失去了一半的價值 對嗎 因爲它不再是最新的了 這些節目在五年後還是一樣好還是一樣壞 就像我們做節目時一樣 互聯網上的標準在變化，所以當我聽我的舊節目時，我有時會感到害怕，因爲現在的標準要高得多，但當你創造常青的內容時，你有兩個觀衆要擔心，你有一個觀衆在等待下一個節目，他們已經聽過其他的節目，他們沒有耐心了。他們會在微博上告訴你節目在哪裏，但你也要告訴他們，這個節目也是爲五年後的人準備的，他們還沒有發現這個節目，也不在乎花了多長時間，因爲他們可以下載整個節目，他們關心的只是質量。所以我總是對新的播客說，他們總是說我讀了所有這些東西，你有一個發佈時間表是非常重要的，但這並不比推出一部好的作品更重要，觀衆會原諒我，如果它花了太長時間，但當你得到它時，它真的很好，他們不會原諒我，如果我急於讓它按時發佈，它是一個垃圾，所以對我們來說。這就是爲什麼當你提到Spotify的交易或其他東西時，他們根本無法干涉，因爲我在這裏的工作，就我而言，就是質量，其他一切都會被忽視，因爲人們唯一關心的是長期的，唯一能讓你長壽的是它有多好，有多好。如果你明天讀Jrr Tolkien的作品，你不會關心他花了多長時間寫的，他只關心今天這本書有多好，這也是我們努力思考的問題。我已經對你做了一千次了，所以你可以讓我回來了，請 有時候，最後期限 你知道一些最偉大的像電影和書都是 你想想像陀思妥耶夫斯基 我忘了哪一個知道從地下或東西 他需要錢，所以他不得不寫它真正的快速 有時候，最後期限創建 有的時候，最後期限會讓一個藝術家的創造性思維變得很強大，就像拍打它一樣，迫使一些好的東西出來。 當然，歷史的問題是，對好的定義有不同的說法。我相信你是... ...你知道... ...再次... ...不要太恭維你，但你是我們這個時代最偉大的講故事的人之一... ...我相信如果你被關在牢房裏，強迫別人用槍指着你，你可以講一個好故事的地獄，但你仍然需要歷史的事實... 確保你畫的是正確的全貌，而不是完全正確 這就是我的意思，聽衆不明白歷史播客是什麼 你不能只說不做，也不能說錯 所以讓我既反對你剛纔說的話，又支持你剛纔說的話 很好，我有一本書，是我寫的，嗯 在一本書中，你有一個嚴格的截止日期，所以哈珀柯林斯對這本書有一個嚴格的截止日期，所以當我發佈這本書時，我很生氣，因爲我本可以寫得更久，這是我的風格，對吧，把它寫好，但我們在那本書中有一個章節，題爲大流行病的序幕，問號，這是關於這本書的部分 我今天早上接受了一位西班牙記者的採訪，他說你有沒有想過你有多幸運，你知道的，首先是大流行病給你帶來的幸運，但如果我有能力的話，我會把那本書放在我的書房裏再研究幾個月。如果我有能力的話，我會把那本書放在我的書房裏再研究幾個月，大流行病就會發生 是的，那一集看起來就像我事後寫的一章，我必須重寫整件事，它就會被認爲是你所說的，同時我也會再花幾個月的時間來研究它，因爲對我來說，它並不是我想要的樣子 因爲對我來說，它還不是我想要的樣子 你能不能給我提示一下你在書架上保留的東西？ 亞歷山大的偉大播客，我已經談過了，我有一天跟別人說，你知道你第一個播客的標題中的第一個詞是什麼嗎？因爲這個節目的標題是亞歷山大與希特勒，所以我圍繞着他的職業生涯談了很多，我在一集裏談到了他的母親，我談到了他死後的葬禮遊戲，我圍繞着這個談了很多，我特別在中間留下了這個巨大的亞歷山大的洞。 因爲有一天我們會做這個節目，我會很享受地談論亞歷山大大帝這個瘋狂有趣的人物，所以這也是後備名單上的一個節目，我們要做的是，每當我們在做第二次世界大戰的亞洲和太平洋的時候 現在我在講第五部分 每當我們講完這個，就會選擇一個非常不同的時期 因爲我們已經講完了，觀衆也講完了 所以是時候了 所以我最終會講到亞歷山大的傳奇故事 那最後一個小部分是什麼呢？ 分鐘，15- 你已經做了很多關於世界大戰的節目，也做了很多關於德國的節目，你會不會考慮做希特勒這個人呢？假設聽衆知道這些細節，只是談論那些奇怪的東西，現在只佔節目的一部分，所以我們做了一個節目，叫做納粹的花絮，它只是一些小東西，你知道它現在完全過時了，比如你知道你仍然可以買到它們，但它們已經過時了。我們在那裏處理了一些事情 你知道這很有趣，但我給你舉另一個例子 我的意思是歷史不是停滯不前的，你知道的 我們之前談到了斯大林，"後代的幽靈 "是多年前完成的，現在人們會從俄羅斯寫信給我，說 說你對斯大林的描寫完全不符合... ...不符合... ...它已經過時了... ...因爲前蘇聯有很多新的東西... ...你轉過身去，你說好吧... ...他們是對的，所以當你談到希特勒的時候，想一想非常有趣 我今天做希特勒的節目和10年前做的節目相比，很有意思 你會想，有什麼新的東西呢？ 我是說，它發生了這麼久，但有很多新的東西，有很多新的獎學金，所以，嗯 是的，我會想，有一天會是一個有趣的節目。我還沒想過，這不在我的口袋裏，但是... ...是的，那會很有趣... ...我有不相稱的力量，因爲我把你困在房間裏，因此在大流行期間，我的希望會停留在你的腦子裏，但在亞歷山大大帝之後 這將是一個了不起的播客 我希望你能給希特勒的迴歸 第三帝國的興衰 對我來說，我有一本當代的書，基本上是的 是的，我正是由一個人誰在那裏希拉 是的，我真的很喜歡研究希特勒的人 我很想聽聽你對它的某些方面的研究 也許還能有一集是關於某個特定時期的 我只是覺得你可以講一個故事，很有趣 希特勒是被研究最多的人之一 我還是覺得所有的故事或 聽着 我家裏有三本書 我現在在所有出版商的名單上 他們都是年輕的希特勒 還有這個希特勒 還有那個 我母親認爲我需要去看心理醫生 因爲我在六歲的時候讀過這本書 她說這孩子有問題，但是... ...但是她是對的，她是完全正確的 但是... ...你會認爲這樣的事情是非常確定的事實 但是一直有新的東西出來 不用說... ...德國一直在調查這個人 有時候需要好幾年才能得到翻譯 我在學校學了五年的德語，我一點都看不懂 所以，我是說... 他是個迷人的人物，整個事情都很古怪 幾年前，有人發現了一盤他和性別談話的錄音帶 我想說的是，那是芬蘭將軍馬納赫姆，對吧 他只是在進行非常正常的談話 你知道希特勒的錄音帶，當你聽到的時候，他通常是在咆哮，但這是一個非常平靜的，我希望我能夠理解德語，以便真正得到一個感覺，因爲我在讀德國人說的話，他們說，哇，你真的可以聽到南方口音。南方口音，你知道只有講母語的人才會聽到的小事 我記得我在想這是這個扭曲的人物的另一面 你會認爲你總是 你會認爲這是在第三等級的興衰中出現的信息，但事實並非如此 所以這這是和那些關於新東西不斷出現的東西亞歷山大 新東西不斷出現，至少是解釋而不是事實的數據
是的，你和你想要的，因爲歷史學的人 人們喜歡這個，這是我缺乏資歷的一個副產品 我們認爲我們要引入歷史學家，我們稱之爲音頻腳註 對，一種讓我說聽着我不是歷史學家，但我要引用這個人，他是，你可以信任他 人們沒有意識到，你知道，如果他們不是歷史專業的，歷史學家並不總是同意這個東西，他們有分歧，他們喜歡這樣，所以我喜歡這個事實，有更多的東西在那裏，因爲它允許我們然後帶來嗯其他觀點和排序也許三 讓故事更加立體化，更加豐滿 最後兩個問題，一個很簡單，一個荒唐可笑，也許也很簡單 首先，Ben是誰，他是真的嗎？ 我甚至不知道你在說什麼，很好，這個答案怎麼樣？ 就像問我Harvey是白兔嗎？我不知道製作室裏到處都是胡蘿蔔 但我不知道那是什麼意思 很多人要求我證明 我想辦法證明他的存在 如果我說他是真的 人們會說他不是 如果我說他是真的 如果他不是真的 他們會說他是的 所以這就像聖誕老人和復活節兔子的感覺 是的，我的意思是什麼是真實的，這正是我告訴他的，如果它存在的話 好吧，最荒謬的問題，我很抱歉，很興奮，但我也不知道這有什麼意義 你是研究人類歷史的，你能理解嗎? 你研究過人類歷史嗎？ 你能理解爲什麼我們會在這塊旋轉的岩石上嗎？ 有什麼意義嗎？ 生命的意義是什麼？ 有時候我覺得很有趣的是，我們在過去的時間裏有一些一致性 歷史不會重複，但它有一個常數，這個常數就是我們，現在我們變了 我剛纔提到了我們生活在一個邪惡的奇怪的時代 社會媒體對我們的影響是小白鼠，這是一個新的因素 但我們仍然是被愛、恨、貪婪、嫉妒、性所驅使的人 我的意思是所有這些東西都會把我們和古人聯繫起來 對，就是這個部分 這就是讓歷史聽起來像押韻的部分 當你把恆定的人類元素和類似的制度混合在一起的時候 古羅馬共和國就是人們經常提到的一個東西 因爲你有兩個騙局，你有人類，就像你那時一樣，你有一個類似於我們這裏的系統，所以你把常數和一個有點類似的系統放在一起，你開始看到的東西，看起來有點押韻。當你把我們放在500年前的亞洲和800年前的非洲時，你會看到所有這些不同的地方，你把小白鼠放在那裏，你會看到小白鼠對不同的刺激和挑戰的反應，我覺得這能幫助我更充實一點。在漫長的時間軸上，我們是誰 不是我們今天是誰，而是我們一直是誰 這是個人的探索，不是爲了教育別人，而是讓我着迷的東西 你認爲在歷史上有共同的人性嗎？ 豚鼠是有一個原因的 在這一切之下，是否有某種感覺，就像某種實驗 哦，現在你進入了埃隆-馬斯克和我談到的這個模擬的事情，對吧，尼克-博斯特羅姆肯定是這樣的想法，有一些孩子，我們相當於外星人的螞蟻農場 你知道，我們希望他不會 我們希望他不要把狼蛛扔進去，看看會發生什麼 我覺得我們不知道爲什麼，我覺得哲學、宗教和那些東西之所以如此有趣，就是因爲它們在努力解決爲什麼 但是我沒有足夠的智慧來提出一個理論，但是我有足夠的興趣來閱讀所有其他的理論。但我有足夠的興趣去讀所有的理論，所以... ...我... ...這麼說吧，我不認爲有任何明確的原因被認同，但各種理論都很吸引人 是的，不管是誰的孩子創造了這個東西... ...螞蟻農場有點兒意思，到目前爲止，有點兒扭曲，有點兒虐待狂 有點變態，有點虐待狂，所以纔有趣 我想，但這是俄羅斯人的觀點 我只是想說這是俄羅斯人的觀點，有點像俄羅斯人的歷史 有一天我會做一些俄羅斯的歷史，我把它帶到了大學 那是螞蟻農場，寶貝 那是一個螞蟻農場，裏面有一個非常沮喪的年輕的... ...嗯，十幾歲的外星人小孩... ...Dan 我不能說我已經誇獎你太多了，我是你的忠實粉絲 這是個不可思議的對話，是個巨大的禮物... ...你的人性的禮物 希望你讓我打斷你，只說你做的很好 這對我來說很有趣，問題和更重要的是，問題可以來自任何人，你的反駁也很精彩，你讓這成爲一個非常有趣的智力討論，謝謝你，好吧，讓我說最後一句話，我同意Elon的觀點，儘管厄運降臨者說，我認爲我們已經得出明確的結論，你沒有機會回應，愛實際上是答案和前進的方向，所以非常感謝Dan，感謝你邀請我，感謝你收聽與Dan Carlin的對話，感謝我們的贊助商競技綠洲的所有 - 一體化的飲料，我每天都用它來覆蓋我所有的營養基礎，簡單安全的家庭安全公司，我用它來監控和保護我的公寓 魔術勺子低碳酮的麥片 如果你喜歡這個東西，請在youtube上訂閱，用五顆星評論它，並在patreon上支持，或在twitter上與我聯繫，Lex friedman。
