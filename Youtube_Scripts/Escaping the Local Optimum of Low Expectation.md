it's wonderful to be here wonderful to see so many faces that I've come to love over the years my advisor my family's here my mom brother you know I did ask security to make sure my dad doesn't he's not allowed in but he somehow found is is his way in so good job the topic of today's talk reminds me of something my dad once told me I wrote it down fewer those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts no wait that that actually was Albert Einstein different different jus similar haircut for those somewhere you know there's a is the same as an old saying that goes give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime little-known fact it actually goes on to say so that he may never discover how much he loves steak or vegetarian lasagna for those of you who are vegetarian in the audience and the key there the key idea is society tries to impose lessons to teach to drive the human being each of us but it's you discovering your passion is the key and that's what the talk I'd like to talk about today and there'll be a lot of poems throughout and the central poem by shel silverstein called the voice is one I think that will resonate throughout the talk there's a voice inside of you the whispers all day long I feel that this is right for me I know that this is wrong no teacher preacher parent friend or wise man can decide what's right for you just listen to the voice that speaks inside this is precisely the voice I'd like to talk about in this in this brief little time we have together over two small topics life and artificial intelligence now from an optimization perspective and one of my co advisers has always told me when you show a plot you have to describe the x axis and the y axis as a good engineer there you go that's lesson number one the x axis is competence the y axis is confidence and this there's a something called the dunning-kruger effect which is captured by this plot and that is at the beginning of your journey of competence when you're not very good at something when you're first taking the first steps of learning something as some of you here are in the engineering fields you're overly confident it's the peak of confidence and you're at the lowest stage of actually of your abilities of your expertise and it's funny that I am speaking here before you today in a place of complete sort of self doubt and despair and not knowing what I'm doing at all and I feel like I have zero expertise to impart on you and so in that sense it's it's a funny position to be speaking with especially some of the lessons some of the advice I'll try to give so take that with a grain of salt and some of you sitting in the audience today maybe at the very peak especially if the year at the beginning of the college journey university journey and I'd say to me the biggest positive the biggest impact of college and university education is the dismantling of the ego that's involved in going from that peak overconfidence to the valley of despair that I'm currently in oh and I should mention that this is also the time for me and perhaps for you where folks like dusty askew start making a lot of sense talking about suffering and pain and how the really great men and women must I think as he says have great sadness on earth this resonates with everybody in their undergraduate years in engineering now the real thing I'd like to talk about is the broader optimization problem formed by the dunning-kruger effect which is after the peak of confidence and the value of despair there's a gradient provided to you by your advisers by your parents by your friends your loved ones society in general the gradient over which you're optimized to achieve a some definition of success this is what I call the local optimum what everybody else tells you you're supposed to do what everybody else at the small scale on a daily scale and on the weekly scale monthly yearly and for the rest of your life tells you what the definition of success is that's the local optimum what I'd like to argue is some ideas of how to break out of that convention of how to listen just enough to hear the lessons in society advises friends and parents but for the rest of it ignore their voices and only listen to your own voice and I'll tell you through my own story here so I was introduced as a research scientist at MIT and very recently I decided to step down from MIT to do my own startup I'm still affiliated there but sort of give up the salary give up everything give up what I'm supposed to be the definition under academic colleagues of what success is of what the pursuit of the academic life is because I'm listening to the voice inside and what and so I'm speaking to you at the very beginning of this journey again full of self-doubt and so take with it with a grain of salt but perhaps it's interesting to speak from this position because I would argue it's the most beautiful position to be in the life the the opportunity the freedom in the struggles that I'm undergoing now is really a gift that comes at the end of this journey of college now Who am I and and what is the dream that I mentioned there at the end the global optimum for me that's understanding the human mind and engineering artificial intelligence systems visualized on the left here is just three percent of the neurons in the human brain it's a mysterious beautiful thing it it's easy to forget how little we know about this mystery that's just between our two years and engineering machines that can reason they can think that can perceive the world is one of the ways we can understand this this this mysterious beautiful thing that brings to life everything around us and the dream of creating intelligent systems companions ones that you can have a deep connection with that's what drives me that's my startup work that's what my entrepreneurship work my research work is focused on most of the work at MIT and before that has been our robotics and autonomous vehicles but now the dream is to create a system that you can love and they can love you back a brief history of artificial intelligence to give you a sense to give you a quick review if this is a totally new field again if your undergraduate perhaps this is a field that you want to that you want to take take on as your journey so started on the theoretical end with Alan Turing and many other ideas from philosophy to mathematics that he presented and from whom the field was born and on the engineering side Frank Rosenblatt and building the perceptron the first machine so engineering machines that can do some aspect of learning some aspect of search that we associate with artificial intelligence and then there's been accomplishments throughout none greater at least to me than in the in this at least for now in a span of games there's been two branches of artificial intelligence that have dominated the field the early days have been you can think of a search its brute-force search it's not quite as captivating to our imagination it doesn't quite feel like intelligence because as brute-force searching through possible answers until you find one that's optimal it's converting every single problem to a search problem and then bringing computational power to it to try to solve it but nevertheless the peak of that especially for those who play chess especially for those who might be a Russian is when I BMD blue defeated Garry Kasparov Kasparov in 1997 this is a seminal moment artificial intelligence where the game that was associated with thought with intelligence with reason was overcome was the greatest champion in human champion was defeated by a machine and the seminal moment on the second branch of artificial intelligence is just learning systems systems that learn from scratch knowing nothing without zero with zero human assistance was able to defeat the greatest player in the world little sidenote the first moment did have human assistance in the alphago system from deep mine and google deepmind and then the follow-on a few months later the system called alpha zero was able to learn from scratch by playing itself this is the to me the greatest accomplishment of artificial intelligence and I'll mention when I discuss about open problems in the field and then in a real-world application like I said I've worked a lot on autonomous vehicles this is one of the most exciting applications with autonomous and semi autonomous vehicles is there's been deployments lessons explorations a lot of different debates this is the most exciting space of artificial intelligence if you want to have an impact as an engineer autonomous vehicles is the space you'll do so in the next in the 2020s and the quick quick whirlwind overview of key ideas in artificial intelligence that were key breakthroughs so neural networks and perceptron like I said was born in the 40s 50s and 60s with the algorithms that dominate today's world of deep learning machine learning have been invented in many many decades ago in the 70s and 80s with convolutional for the computer vision aspect of things in the in the 80s and 90s with LS TM are a recurrent neural networks they work with language work with sequence of data were developed in 90s and proven out in the arts and then did deep learning quote-unquote revolution the term and the ideas of large-scale machine learning using neural networks was reborn in 2006 in the early arts and then proven out in the examiner image in that moment when computer vision systems were able to in in the challenge of computer object recognition image recognition and the image net data set in the image net challenge neural networks were able to far outperform the the competition and do so easily from just learning from data and a few other developments there's a lot of unsupervised learning self supervised learning ideas that were born in the 14 15 16 just a few years ago and a lot of exciting ideas in the past few years the past few years have been dominated by ideas and natural language processing with ideas of transformers anyway this might be outside the scope of what you you're familiar with I encourage you to look into it transformers in particular with natural languages some of the most beautiful and exciting ideas that without any human supervision you can learn the model language sufficiently well to outperform any anything we've done previously to do things like machine translation to a level that's unprecedented is really exciting and especially exciting is that bigger is better meaning that as long as we can scale compute we can perform better and better and better and it's a totally open question how what the ceiling of that is and finally the most exciting thing in artificial intelligence is the idea you know is a there's a concept of big bang for the start of the universe a silly name for one of the most incredible mystery of our human existence same way self play is one of the silliest names for one of the most powerful ideas and artificial intelligence it's the mechanism behind out for zero is a system playing against itself to improve continuously without any human supervision that is the most exciting aspect the most exciting area that I'm excited and I recommend if you love learning that you explore so the open problems in artificial intelligence and possible solutions and one of the things and I'll focus on number four which is something that I am that is my dream that is sort of my life aspiration but I'll give a whirlwind introduction learning to understand learning to act reason and a deep connection between humans and AI systems so learning to understand there's a lot of exciting possibilities here this is a lot of the breakthroughs in machine learning have been in something called supervised learning we have a set of data and you have a neural network or a model that's able to learn from that data in order to generalize sufficiently to infer on cases hasn't seen before you could recognize cat versus dog in the case of domain in the domains of like autonomous driving you can recognize lane markings you could recognize other vehicles pedestrians all the different subtasks involved in solving a particular problem now that's all good but to solve real world problems you have to actually you have to deal with endless edge cases the we human beings effortlessly take care of that our ability to do reasoning and common-sense reasoning effortlessly takes care of so be able to learn over all those education you have to do much larger scale learning and for that you have to be much more selective and clever about which data you annotate with human beings and that's the idea of active learning same way with as children we explore the world we interact with the world to pick up the lessons from it the same way you can interact with the data set to select only small parts of it to learn from I'll take Tesla which is a car company and that's using autonomous driving in its system autopilot that uses deep learning to learn how to solve all these different problems I'll use them as a case study what they're doing is quite interesting in the space of active learning they're creating a pipeline for each individual task they take the task of driving and break it apart and to now over a hundred different subtasks each sub task gets its own pipeline its own data set and there's a machine learning system that learns from that data set and is then deployed back into the vehicles and when the vehicle fails in a particular case that's an edge case that's marked for the system and is brought back to the pipeline too to annotate so there's ongoing pipeline that continuously goes on the system is not very good at the beginning but the whole purpose of it is to discover edge cases in the same way that human us humans learn something and you can think of our actually existence in the world as an edge-to-edge case discovery mechanism so you learn something you construct a mental model of the world and you move about the world until you run up against the case a situation that you totally didn't expect and we do those would do that thousands of times a day still and we learn from those and that pipeline of active learning is really exciting area that very few people are working on especially in the space of research to me that's the most exciting in terms of scale of impact area in the next few years learning to act the second set of open problems in artificial intelligence this is where the idea of self play comes in is learning to build systems whether through a reinforcement learning mechanism or otherwise that are actually acting in the world in the case of self play the idea is that you have a really dumb system in the beginning that knows nothing again no human supervision and through randomization you have other systems that also know nothing but know a different set of nothing and they compete against each other so you can you formulate the problem as a competitive setting and when you have to dumb systems that compete against each other a magical thing happens the one that's slightly less dumb starts winning and this little incremental step can be repeated arbitrarily and without any constraints on human supervision annotation cost without any constraints I'm having to sort of bring the human in the loop or bring the physical world in the loop it can all do be done in computation in distributive sense so you can in a matter of hours on a distributed computing create a system that beats the world champion at go and in fact with deep mind and all the games that have they've defeated the world champion chess not just the world champion is the the best chess playing program stockfish in in a matter of hours of training and the ceiling hasn't yet been reached this is both the exciting and the scary thing about self play is very few times is the ceiling ever reached what we hit is the limits of our computational power which is computation power especially the kind of mechanisms that are happening now the developments happening now are can the Moore's law has continued in many ways the computation if you just wait a few years computation is increasing so we were yet to see the ceiling of the capabilities that these approaches are able to achieve this should be both exciting and terrifying okay the total biggest open problem that nobody even knows how to do there's this is an example of a state-of-the-art dog intelligence system solving a particular problem so we know nothing how to do about how do how do how to do reasoning systems in artificial intelligence this is the actually not very often talked about area because nobody know what to do about it there's been subsets called program synthesis communities that kind of try to formulate a subset of the reasoning problem and try to solve it but we don't know much to do particularly common sense reasoning how to formulate enough about the world to be able to reason about the physics of the world about the basic especially with human beings human human human to physical world dynamics just there's millions of facts seemingly that are intricately connected that we we learned and we accumulate in a knowledge base this process is a really exciting area of research that nobody knows what to do with the things I've described previously don't really have anything to do with humans necessarily the by passion and my interest is that space between machine and human the community broadly could be called human robot interaction but there's a lot of different areas in which there's a deep connection between a human and machine that you all experience every day so recommender systems from Netflix to much more importantly social networks the recommendation engines behind social networks recommending what you see next in terms of both advertisement and both about the the content of your friends that you see which friends you get to see more from the personalization of IOT of smart systems semi autonomous systems like the test autopilot and different semi autonomous vehicles like the Cadillac super cruise systems whenever you have AI systems between you and a machine so there is a machine that does that automate some particular tasks there's you human that are tasked with sitting there and supervising the Machine and there is an AI system in the middle that manages that and manages the tension that dance the uncertainty the human that all the the t-word that trust all the mess of human beings it manages that that it's a really exciting space that is in the very early days what I show there is what my sense is where we stand in 1998 there was a lot of search engines some of you may even be old enough to have used them AltaVista excite ask gee is like us and so on then Google came along the Google search engine and blew them all out of the water they were all working on a very interesting very important problem but the approach and the fundamental ideas behind their approach was flawed I believe that personal assistance and a personal deep meaningful connection between an AI system and a human being is that's exactly where we're at many people have in their home and Alexa device a Google home device but most people don't use it for almost anything except to play music or check the weather many of you use Twitter and social networks but artificial intelligence plays a minimal role it understands almost nothing about you in recommending how you interact with the platform or the advertisements you see and autonomous vehicles robotics platforms know almost nothing about you so shown there is the Tesla vehicle it knows almost nothing about you except whether your hands are on the steering wheel or not it's I believe it'll be obvious in retrospect how much opportunity there is to learn about human beings from the devices and from that to form a deep meaningful connection so now to return to my value of despair to give some words of advice and again take them with a grain of salt so in this context in this optimization context my first piece of advice is to listen to your inner voice I think a lot of people including a lot of very smart professors advisers parents friends significant others have in them a kind of mutually agreed-upon gradient along which they push you I it's it's so difficult for me to articulate this in a clear way but early on I I heard it within myself a silly sounding crazy voice that told me to do things one of which was to try to put a robot in every home there's dreams that are difficult for me to articulate but if you allow your mind to be quiet enough you hear such voices you'll hear such dreams and it's important to really listen and to pursue them advice number two is carve your own path if that means taking a few detours take the detours again this is coming from the valley of despair so I hope this pans out in the end but I had many detours in music I was in a band at long hair I did I gave a lot of myself to the practice of martial arts and both both music and martial arts have given me again very difficult to put into words but have given me something something quite profound it gave flavor and color to the to the pursuit of that dream that's hard to articulate it's because I've listened to my instincts into my heart and pursuing these detours some poetry to to excessive reading like I mentioned I took a James Joyce course here so pursuing these avenues of knowledge through philosophy and history that seemingly have nothing to do with the main pursuit and starting the silliest of pursuits starting a podcast advice number three is to measure measure passion not progress so most of us get an average of about 27,000 days of life I think a good metric by which you should live is to maximize the number of those days that are filled with a passionate pursuit of something not by how much you've progressed towards a particular goal because goals are grounded in your comparison to other human beings to something that's already been done before passionate Judith something is the way you achieved something totally new and a quick warning about passion again I'm a little bit of Russian so maybe I romanticize this whole suffering and passion thing but the people who love you the people who care for you like like I mentioned your friends your family should not be trusted except their love but not their advice parents and significant others will tell you to find a secure job because passion looks dangerous it looks insecure advisors colleagues will tell you to be pragmatic because passionate looks like a distraction from the main effort that you should be focusing on and society will tell you to be to find balance work-life balance in your life because passion looks unhealthy advice number 4 continuing on the unhealthy part is work hard make a habit of working hard every day putting in the hours there's a lot of books and a lot of advice have been written on working smart and not working hard I'm yet to meet anyone who has not truly worked hard for thousands of hours in order to accomplish something great in order to work smart you first have to put in those few tens of thousands of hours of really dumb brute force hard work of all-nighters the key there is to minimize stress not to minimize the amount of hours of work and to do that is you have to love what you do and the final piece of advice that picture okay it's to look up to the stars and appreciate every single moment you're alive at the mystery of this world at the the beauty of this world I again this is my perspective taken with a grain of salt but I advise the forever oscillate between deep profound doubt and self dissatisfaction and the deep gratitude for the moment for just being alive for all the people around you that give you their love with whom you get to share those moments to share the love a poem by Stephen Crane that I especially like in the desert in the desert I saw a creature naked beastial who's squatting upon the ground held this heart in his hands and ate of it I said is a good friend it is bitter bitter he answered but I like it because it is bitter and because it is my heart so I would say the bitter is the self desatting not to think that's the Restless energy that drives us forward and then enjoying that bitterness and enjoying the moment and enjoying the sweetness that comes from eating your own heart in this poem is is the thing that makes life worthwhile and that is to me happiness so with those silly few pieces of advice I'd like to continue on the gratitude and say thank you thank you to my advisor thank you to this University for giving me a helping hand there you go and thank you to my family and all the friends that I've had along the way thank you for their love I appreciate it [Applause] I've never been introduced with this much energy I really appreciate it yes by the way thank you for that question how how's your daily life affected by the meaninglessness of it all so the answer is yes and it's hard to use reason to justify that life is meaningful I think you have to listen to like there's something in you that makes life beautiful so if you look at something like Elon Musk he believes that interplanetary so colonizing Mars is like that's what that's like one of the most exciting things we human beings can do and so if you allow yourself to think what is the most exciting thing that we human beings can do and and and if you're and see that the work you're doing is part of that for me like if I were to psychoanalyze myself there's something in me that's deeply fulfilling about creating intelligent systems that that's so exciting to me that we human beings can create intelligent systems I see artificial intelligence as the next evolution of human civilization and to me that makes it somehow deeply exciting even though eventually the whole universe will collapse on itself or the other the cold death of the universe side there's something within that that's so exciting so my first take is I love it how much fellow colleagues and scientists are uncomfortable with this question so I love it I love to ask it just because it makes them uncomfortable it yeah it's appreciate it it's a good like I don't know maybe in like French cuisine you have to like cleanse the palate it's a good question to ask like we're now we're not now talking about the latest paper we're now talking about the bigger questions of life that the simulation question is a nice one to do that in terms of actually practically I think it's there's two interesting things to say so one it's interesting to me I'm a big fan of virtual reality I love I love the war I love entering worlds even primitive as they are now that are virtual I can already imagine that more and more people would want to live in those worlds it's an interesting question to me how real do those worlds need to become in order for you to want to stay there and not return to the real world so the question of the simulation is how real do we need to simulate the world in order for you to enjoy better than this one that's a computer science question that's really interesting that's a it's a like practical engineering question because you can create virtual reality systems I'll make a lot of money perhaps have a detrimental effect on society by having people want to stay in the virtual worlds and then the the other question is the physics question of quantum mechanics of like what is the fundamental fabric of reality and is it you know the what does it take to simulate that reality and that's that's like a physics question how is it finite as an infinite what are the mechanisms the the underlying mechanisms there's a goal as the law of string theory does it go below string theory and there's actually people that written papers on how big a computer needs to be in order to simulate that kind of system and now quantum computers are coming forward which is one of the exciting applications of quantum computing is to be able to simulate quantum mechanical systems this is the question how big there's a quantum computer have to be to simulate the universe it's a fun but a real physics question way out of reach of our engineering capabilities but it's just it's not it's a nice party over the beer over beers think to bring up with scientists yeah there's two things I make scientists uncomfortable and I love bringing up one is the simulation question and the other is what do you think about the idea that's become popular recently that the earth might be flat they get really like they get angry actually you know he's quite outpaced by today scientists like the greatest science ever looking the define greatness as when it comes to the pursuit of an endeavor those are all looking for the most advancement in the field given your starting point does it come from the journey and the work associated or destination is there some concept so thank you for that question very well right now and thought out there's a personal greatness from the perspective of the individual for me like for me greatness is doing what I love that's that ignores the rest of society it's just like to me I'm the greatest human to have ever lived in my own little world for having to do the things I love and that that that that's from my perspective and I love this the the craftsmanship of it anything it could be anything he's just doing the skill so that's not about accomplishment that's not about anything that's about just doing the things you love from the perspective of society they tend to then tell stories about these pursuits and they they like to like greatness is something that people invent they give Nobel Prizes give prizes to accomplishment it kind of tells stories about human beings about Steve Jobs about about different icons and some are completely ignored to history some are glorified their history with like over glorified I recently found out that the Pythagorean theorem was not in developed by Pythagoras I read it on Wikipedia I don't know if it's true but you know that's that's that's an example of somebody I at least thought was kind of an actual entity an actual human being that was great and associated with this idea so to me I think greatness is doing the things you love and the rest is just luck whether they tell a good story about you or not [Applause]
