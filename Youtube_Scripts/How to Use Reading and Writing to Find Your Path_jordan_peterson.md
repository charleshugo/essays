我希望爲你提供的是一個神奇的密碼，你知道前一陣子有一本書出版了，湯姆-漢克斯在電影中扮演一個哈佛大學的教授，他到處解開象徵性的謎團，你還記得是什麼嗎，叫達芬奇密碼，大家都喜歡，它賣得很好，你知道它充滿了小謎團，它充滿了暗示，世界比你想象的更多，這絕對是真的，你知道有一種方法可以獲得這些知識，這真的是很值得的。人們喜歡這樣，他們喜歡這樣的想法，原因是它實際上是真實的，是真實的，就像小說是真實的一樣，所以好吧，讓我們回到那個告訴你他的早晨的人，他告訴你一些令人興奮的事情，那麼想象一下，10個人告訴你一些令人興奮的事情，然後你從中提取出他們處理這個問題的模式，那麼你就有一個，如果你是一個作者，你會怎麼做，對嗎，因爲在一本書中，你不希望書中完全是 就像你已經知道如何在你生活中的普通時期成爲普通人一樣，那是沒有用的，你知道你不會看自己的錄像帶，想象一下你在一天中對自己進行錄像，然後第二天再看，就像上帝一樣，誰會想這麼做呢？ 所以在故事中似乎發生了什麼，他們提煉了他們，所以他們觀察人們，人們觀察人們，然後他們講述他們所看到的故事，但他們留下了很多 然後越來越多的關於令人興奮的事情的故事被聚集起來，然後也許一個偉大的作家出現了，寫出了非常非常有趣的東西，深刻的角色轉變，然後你說這是虛構的，然後你說這不是真的，因爲它是虛構的，但然後也許這是不對的，也許這比真實更重要，因爲誰想要真相，真相是平凡的現實，你已經掌握了這個，你想要的是什麼？你可能會想，爲什麼會有趣呢？ 這是個很好的問題，因爲你並不知道，相信我，你真的不知道，因爲你會對那些毫無意義的事情感興趣 今天我將帶你瞭解一下《皮諾曹》，下次我們也會這樣做的。迪斯尼的電影《木偶奇遇記》 好吧，很多人 所以這本身就很奇怪了，有那麼多人看過，這值得思考 你會給你的孩子看那部電影，但你想想看，當你坐在那裏看那部電影的時候，你會做一些很奇怪的事情 首先，那是畫畫，而且是低分辨率的畫，你不在乎 你看《辛普森一家》，也許還有那個叫什麼來着，那個一直在關注政治正確問題的人 《南方公園》，天啊，那動畫太可怕了，太可怕了，再糟糕不過了 你不在乎，就像圓圓的腦袋笑一笑，有一點晃動，那就是一個人，對你來說，這無關緊要，如果分辨率再高一點，也無濟於事 你只需要最基本的東西，把你的看法掛在上面 所以你看這幅畫，是皮諾曹的動畫，漂亮的畫，有順序 你不是在看真實的東西，而是在看一個純建築，然後你想一下這個情節 這就像它是完全荒謬的 關於它的一切都很荒謬 就像其中一個角色是一隻蟲子 他變成了良心的化身 所以這到底是怎麼回事 然後另一個角色是一個木偶牽線人 你知道不知怎麼的他擺脫了牽線的束縛 然後開始了這個冒險 然後是 然後你知道他被一隻狐狸和一隻貓引誘到各種邪惡的地方 然後他從鯨魚那裏救出了他的父親 你甚至不知道他父親是怎麼進鯨魚的 你最後一次見到他的父親是在暴風雨中，而接下來發生的事情是他在鯨魚中，你坐在那裏想，嘿，沒問題，這一切都很有意義，就像什麼真的爲什麼，這怎麼會有意義呢？你不知道 你甚至不知道你在看什麼 但這並不重要 你看着它，你對它很感興趣 你想看看這個木偶到底發生了什麼 你想看看他最後會不會變成一個真正的男孩 因爲這很重要 這似乎很重要 你說皮諾曹是真的嗎？ 這是個愚蠢的問題，部分是個愚蠢的問題，因爲答案是這取決於你說的真實是什麼意思 對我來說，當你說某件事情是真實的，你應該是什麼意思並不明顯，我之所以不明顯是因爲我們的社會有這樣的想法，這是一個非常深刻的想法，這個想法是終極真理是科學真理，它告訴我們關於世界的本質，它以某種最終方式來做這件事。物理學家已經得到了它，這就是爲什麼他們可以製造氫彈，這是一個相當好的證明，他們是正確的，但你不採取行動，如果這是真的，你不這樣做，你看事情，注意事情，被那些不以這些假設爲前提的事情所吸引，在我看來，有一個問題，世界是由什麼組成的，但有一個更大的問題，這是你應該如何在世界中行爲的問題 這就是你想知道的東西 人們想知道的東西比什麼都多，因爲你需要知道 就像你們在大學裏，你們不知道自己在做什麼 我是說你們有些人知道的比別人多，但你們正處於人生的起點，生活是非常複雜和混亂的，它並不完全明顯 你知道你應該建立什麼樣的關係，或者你應該發展什麼樣的性格，或者你要做什麼工作，或者人生的意義是什麼 你知道人們來到大學，至少是很多人，這就是他們想要找到的東西。 帕格里亞的概念是，你可以這樣想，明確的知識是嵌入在不明確的知識中的，不明確的知識是文學、藝術和高級文化的領域，比方說，我們知道它意味着什麼，但我們並不確切知道它意味着什麼，它比我們知道的更多，然後在這之外是我們根本不知道的東西。這也是Jung提出的一個觀點，也許Paglia是從Jung那裏學來的，因爲Jung認爲，你知道有這樣一個領域，我們已經掌握了每一個領域，然後在這個領域之外還有一個領域，你可以認爲是未開發的領域，我們遇到未開發的領域是我們的創造性想象力，我們試圖用我們的創造性想象力做的是想出如何處理這個未開發的領域，我們正在製作戲劇，我們可以表演出來 這將幫助我們處理我們還沒有掌握的東西 然後在這之外，還有我們根本不知道的東西 帕格里亞的想法，這也是瓊的想法，如果不理解周圍 你太原子化了，你不是你歷史的一部分 你沒有融入你的祖先的精神，他們建立了這一切，你現在只是在這裏，你也不知道該做什麼，你不知道如何保持你的文化，你不知道如何服務它，你知道你可能會說 我有個假設，你可以想一想 我不知道這是不是真的，但人們會問生命的意義是什麼 在我看來，意義與責任的承擔成正比 比如說你有個三歲的小妹妹，你要照顧她 懷疑這是不是個好主意，似乎很愚蠢 顯然，讓我們說這是你所做的，你覺得這很有意義，這就像你知道與一個小孩子互動，當我們當我有小孩子的時候，你知道當他們像兩歲或以下的時候，我們帶他們出去看他們的親戚，他們是老年人，你知道他們看着那個兩歲的 你知道他們看着那個兩歲的孩子，就像看着一團火一樣 你知道那個小孩子在房間裏的每一秒，每個成年人都在關注着他或她 這就是人們關注的東西，這就是意義的來源 還有什麼是有意義的呢？ 你的家庭關係對你來說是有意義的 也許你作爲一個朋友承擔的責任是有意義的 也許你決定追求一個特定的職業 你知道這其中有一部分是由你想要建立一些安全感和出人頭地的願望所決定的，這很好，但你也在維護支持你的結構方面發揮着不可或缺的作用，我的觀察是，在我的臨牀實踐中，人們只是有一個地獄般的時間，如果他們沒有，如果他們沒有在某個地方插入，你知道，你認爲我必須在早上九點去工作。你知道，我有一個嚴格的時間表，這可能是一個很好的主意，因爲我注意到，如果人們從那些外部支架系統中抽離出來，他們就會漂移，他們就會抑鬱，他們就會焦慮，他們不知道該如何對待自己，他們有點像沒有雪橇的雪橇犬，我們有點像雪橇犬，就我所知，我們是負擔的野獸，我們需要 問題是你需要什麼樣的負擔 這就是我認爲我們需要的原因 你知道，我一直在思考如何弄清楚什麼是真實的，已經有很長一段時間了 因爲我是一個存在主義者，我的工作前提是，你可以通過觀察他們的行爲來判斷人們的信仰 我不關心他們說什麼，也不關心他們對現實的說法是什麼
   因爲他們對現實的看法和他們的實際行動之間的關係並不完美，有時甚至不存在，我注意到的一點是，人們沒有人與自己的痛苦爭論，每個受傷的人都表現得好像他們相信痛苦是真實的，所以我們可以說最終的現實是痛苦，這就是人們的行爲方式，這與許多宗教傳統的主張一致，你知道猶太人總是回憶過去的痛苦，我是說基督教的上帝是一個被釘死的人。我的意思是那裏有相當多的痛苦 對於佛教徒來說，基本的格言是生命是痛苦的 在我看來，那裏有一個形而上學的主張 形而上學的主張是痛苦是真實的 現在當然要看你說的真實是什麼意思 但是人們表現得好像他們的痛苦是真實的 所以這是一個很好的開始 現在這帶來了一個問題 生命是一種痛苦 生命是痛苦 我們說，爲什麼是這樣呢 因爲你可以被打破 傷害和毀滅 所以這似乎很自我 你知道的，這使人變得獨特，就像那是我們的自我意識，對嗎，這就是我們在某種意義上與其他生物的區別，我的意思是，其他生物有一些自我意識，比如黑猩猩可以學會在鏡子裏認識自己，在海豚裏泡着，但你知道，那是相當的，那是相當原始的自我意識，你知道真正的自我 就我所知，人類是唯一發現了未來的生物，這很好，因爲我們可以計劃未來，但這很糟糕，因爲你知道未來是有限的，這對舊系統是個很大的衝擊，這是每個人都要承擔的生存負擔，它與痛苦緊密相連，所以你認爲生命是痛苦的，它是有限的，這就是痛苦的一部分，這也是你的一部分。你質疑存在的價值，也許質疑存在本身的價值，那麼你要用什麼作爲武器來對付它呢？ 你知道我們談了一點關於責任的問題，這似乎是有效的，你知道你在與事物的關係上所採取的責任量似乎會增加你有意義的參與，你可能會說好吧，什麼是最有意義的參與活動，你可能會說好吧，減少一點舊的痛苦，你知道，這樣你的生活就不會造成不適當的痛苦，特別是 毫無意義的痛苦，這很好，也許你甚至可以比這更有用，你可以想出一些辦法，讓你的其他人的一些痛苦得到糾正，如果你真的你知道打了一個全壘打，也許你可以想出一些辦法，讓一些痛苦得到糾正，這本身似乎是有意義的，我是說如果是痛苦讓你懷疑生命的意義，這是完全合理的，那麼這種停止痛苦，停止痛苦，儘量減少痛苦的邏輯推論，應該是適當的藥物治療，所以我說 我想說的是，這意味着有一些模式可以讓你成爲一個好人，而作爲一個好人的一部分就是減輕痛苦，我不認爲你可以質疑這一點，實際上，如果如果痛苦本身是讓你質疑你生命的有效性，那麼你也不能說停止痛苦是沒有用的，我的意思是你可以，但這是完全不連貫的，你可以，如果你願意，你可以聲稱不連貫的事情，所以我想說這些提煉的故事，我在談論這些故事，是由偉大的作家寫的。我特別喜歡陀思妥耶夫斯基，他的作品比我讀過的任何小說家的作品都要好，他處理了人類面臨的最困難的問題，他的作品中的人物都是爭論的雙方，他們都是 他們真正闡述了論點 這不像陀思妥耶夫斯基 你知道他有一個信仰，所以他有一個角色，這個角色有他的信仰，這個角色總是贏得論點，這在陀思妥耶夫斯基的小說中根本沒有發生。他設定了一個人物，然後設定了三四個對立面，這些對立面不是稻草人，而是鐵巨人，他們只是在踩踏他的主人公，你知道，整個故事就是這些不同的存在概念之間的戰爭，看到它很神奇，讀到它也很神奇，所以你提煉這些故事，偉大的作家提煉故事，偉大的說書人提煉故事，我們有非常非常非常古老的故事，這些通常是某種形式的宗教故事，但它們可以是童話故事，因爲童話故事有些人把童話故事追溯到你知道的超過一萬年。所以它們是口述傳統的一部分 口述傳統可以持續幾萬年 你知道一個故事被講了一萬年是個有趣的故事 就像人們記住了它，並且明顯地進行了修改 就像電話遊戲一樣，我告訴你一些事情，你悄悄地告訴你旁邊的人等等 就像一個電話遊戲，已經持續了一千代，剩下的就是人們記得的東西，也許他們記得重要的東西 因爲你傾向於記住重要的東西 而且不一定你知道它到底是什麼意思 你不知道音樂是什麼意思，但你知道這並不妨礙你聽它 你不知道一般來說你看的電影或讀的書是什麼意思 如果它是深刻的，它的意思比你能理解的多，因爲否則爲什麼要讀它 好了，這個想法是，我們必然嵌套在道德體系中 道德體系是以敘述爲前提的 敘述的各種戲劇 道德體系是我們生活的方向，之所以要儘可能地理解它們 是因爲你需要知道如何生活 尼采說過，如果你有一個 "WHY"，你就能承受任何事情，這很好 學會寫作 我是認真的，我是認真的，因爲寫作 因爲寫作是一種正式的思考方式，所以你的寫作方式是首先你需要一個問題，因爲如果你沒有問題，爲什麼要寫呢？ 所以這是一個很好的建議，如果你只是寫一篇文章，順便爲你的課程寫一個該死的問題，你想寫的是什麼？否則從一開始就是假的 要靠你自己去接觸材料，直到找到你想要研究的東西 好吧，你需要一個問題 接下來你需要做的是，我們需要對這個問題有所交代 閱讀 閱讀對這個問題很有幫助 儘可能多地閱讀你能接觸到的問題 好吧，現在你現在知道了一堆東西，或者至少是暫時知道了它們 你至少可以接觸到它們 現在你開始整理一下，就像好吧 也許我需要總結我所學到的東西 然後我需要消除我所學到的東西之間的矛盾 我需要優雅地表達出來 我需要正確地選擇我的詞，選擇我的短語，選擇我的句子 我需要把句子組織成適當的段落，把段落組織成適當的順序 這樣我就有了一個連貫的論點 同時，你正在做的是 你是你是你是 嗯 你在最高和最抽象的組織層面上整合自己的個性，你在 你在磨練你的工具，你在把自己擺正，因爲你在學習思考，你通過寫作來學習這樣做，所以我會說選擇一些困難的問題，學習非常非常仔細地寫作，當我說注意單詞的時候，我的意思是選擇正確的單詞，把它們組織成正確的短語，把你的句子擺正，比如當我寫第一本書《意義地圖》的時候，我相信我把那本書的每個句子寫了50次，每個句子有50種變化，我讀一遍，再讀一遍，我再寫一遍，我有一個小小的 競爭哪個句子更好 哪個句子更好 我就選那個句子 段落也是如此 經過多年的磨練，你的文字是你最強大的東西，沒有之一 如果你是一個有效的作家、演講者和溝通者 你就擁有了所有的權威和能力 所以你在大學裏，也許你在修讀人文學位 人文學位是用來教你如何思考的 你通過寫作學會思考 現在還有很多東西要讀要講，所有這些 你能做的就是每天閱讀和寫作，每天幾個小時，寫一些你認爲重要的事情，看看你是否能發現你認爲是真實的東西，這將爲你打下基礎，這非常實用，如果你看看那些在生活中取得驚人成功的人，有各種原因，但其中一個原因是，他們非常善於表達他們的目標，制定戰略，進行談判，用願景吸引人們前進，這就像把你的話放在一起，這就是 這讓你勢不可擋，這纔是人文學科的核心思想 把你的話語整合在一起，讓你成爲一個能說會道的生物，然後你就會以最好的方式死去，所以要認真對待這一點，最後我也要告訴大家，你們這些學生，在你們比較憤世嫉俗的時候，可能會認爲你們必須向教授提供他們想要的東西，並對你們語言的內容進行刪減，以適應他們的喜好，或者你們認爲是他們的喜好 首先，只有極少數的教授纔會 首先，只有極少數的教授會因爲你寫了一篇他們不同意的高質量論文而對你進行懲罰，雖然這應該受到譴責，但這並不經常發生，更重要的是，這樣做是呃，是最高的學術罪過，因爲你在這裏要做的是學會找到自己真正的聲音，每當你因爲權宜之計而偏離了這一點，你就敗壞了自己，而且不是以一種微不足道的方式，因爲當你制定論點時，就成爲你性格中永久的一部分，你帶着它，成爲結構的一部分，通過它
   它成爲你看待世界的結構的一部分 並指導你的行動 所以你要保持你的言語的純潔性 你要以一種專心致志的方式工作 以使你變得儘可能的口齒清晰 沒有什麼比這更實際和高尚的了 同時這也是爲什麼人文學科如此有價值 你知道你認爲一個人文學科學位有什麼用 希望對每個人都有好處 這就是我的建議 我非常欣賞人文學科和大學 我是說人文學科 你通過人文學科學會做一個公民 人文學科是西方文化的核心 如果它們消失了 我們就有麻煩了 問題是大學裏的人文學科已經不再是人文學科了 所以當我告訴人們不要去上大學的人文課程時 我的心情很沉重 相信我 現在的問題是你該去哪裏呢？ 這是個好問題 你可以隨時閱讀 亞馬遜的一個特點是所有的好書都是免費的 真的是免費的 你可以在你的Kindle上免費下載它們 所以西方世界的偉大書籍，甚至是20世紀的許多偉大書籍現在都是完全免費的，所以你可以閱讀它們 現在在Youtube上可以獲得很多信息，這在未來10年內真的會爆發 我的意思是，在未來10年內，我想做的一件事就是在網上建立一所人文大學。 我們設計這些程序的部分目的是幫助人們學習寫作，同時也幫助他們寫出自己的故事。 當我們讓學生做這個未來寫作計劃的時候，發生的事情非常酷，他們留在學校的概率提高了大約30%，但更酷的事情發生了，對錶現最差的學生效果最好。羅德曼-羅特丹管理學院在伊拉斯謨大學，我們有幾個人，我想大概有一萬人參加了未來創作計劃，如果你看一下學生的學術表現，荷蘭女性，荷蘭本地女性處於巔峯，然後是荷蘭男性，在他們下面，女性是少數，她們可能被選得更多一些，對吧，所以也許這就是表現差距的原因。 然後下面是女性非西方少數民族移民，再下面是男性非西方少數民族移民，荷蘭女性和男性非西方少數民族移民之間存在着巨大的差距，比如說，在寫完未來創作計劃的兩年內，男性非西方少數民族的學生通過了荷蘭人的考試，成績差距約爲80%。 是的，他們中的一些人甚至不記得他們曾經做過未來創作練習，我們在莫霍克大學複製了這一做法，就在不久前，上莫霍克大學的年輕人在上大學前的夏天做了這個練習，他們只花了大約一個小時就寫出了自己的未來，思考自己的整個未來並沒有那麼長。 是的，所以我們對此感到非常興奮 我之所以告訴你們這個故事，除了因爲它很有趣之外，還因爲我們正在嘗試用技術來教人們如何寫作 通常教人們如何寫作的方法是讓人編輯你的文章，但這是非常昂貴的，我不認爲它可以被轉化爲可以使用的東西 所以我們要做的是把寫作的過程分解成必要的步驟，這也是行爲心理學家所做的，我們已經用這種論文寫作格式做了一些工作，然後教人們寫作的機械原理，然後也許會嘗試找出衆包編輯的方法，讓很多人都能參與到這個過程中來，但我們想在未來10年建立一所在線人文大學。未來10年，既然大學已經放棄了他們的知識產權，那就沒有理由不直接進入並拿走它，就我所知，我的同事和我在網上開發了這個程序，幫助人們寫出他們的生活，所以它的過去創作程序幫助人們寫一本自傳，我到底是誰，你認爲你知道，但你不知道，因爲你很複雜，然後現在的創作程序幫助你確定你的缺點和 這不是強加給你的，而是一個被引導的探索過程，然後，未來創作程序幫助你弄清楚，如果你能擁有你想要的東西，那麼假設一下，那究竟是什麼，是的，非常值得問自己這個問題，因爲無論如何，你總是在尋找這個問題，甚至是消極的，因爲你的良心會折磨你，因爲你沒有做的事情還好，沒有做的事情與什麼有關。與你的良知的隱含理想有關 那是什麼 答案是你不知道 所以如果你只是讓自己被折磨得服服帖帖 那麼你就會被一些你不知道的理想所擺佈 你不知道 也許你也不想去追求 如果你真的知道的話 這就是爲什麼Junk Carl Jung說每個人都活在一個神話裏 但幾乎沒有人知道他們活在哪個神話裏 也許這是一個悲劇 也許你不希望它是一個悲劇 還有一個問題，你想要什麼，這是一個非常深刻的問題，我是說你，這是一個嚴肅的問題，你應該重視的是什麼，人們說快樂，他們甚至不是這個意思，順便說一下，如果你把人們的意思分解一下，當他們說他們想要快樂的時候，實際上他們的意思是他們不想痛苦，他們更關心的是避免痛苦，而不是追求你知道的積極的情感，所以即使是這樣的說法 所以即使是 "我想快樂 "這句話也不能準確地反映出你想要的是什麼 這是不是說明我們能看到的自己的動機是多麼的少 我們是如此善於欺騙，在欺騙別人之前，我們先欺騙自己 我們能看到這一小片一小片的爲什麼我們在這裏 爲什麼我們會做我們所做的事情 爲什麼我們會想我們所想的事情 我今天看到羅伯特-懷特的這句話，說情緒是我們基因的執行者或基因的執行者，它們的作用是 它們的存在只是爲了執行我們的生物指令，然後我們可以瞥見它們在做某件事情的過程中跑過去，我們相信我們在某種程度上是在窺視我們自己心靈的源代碼，但事實並非如此，我們對自己絕對不是透明的，如果我們像我們這樣透明，我們就不必花幾十年時間研究心理學了。 我們在自我創作計劃中所做的一件事是說，如果你根據自己的惡習而惡化，而且一發不可收拾，那麼五年後的情況會是怎樣的呢 你知道大家都知道有些人有些人與酗酒或吸毒調情 或者是性癮 是的，是的，沒錯，關係破裂了，甚至是糖果什麼的 然後你知道你心裏有一種感覺，如果你放任自己，你會是什麼樣子 哦，我是個病人，我會在一座橋下或其他地方 我可能會在一個我不知道的地方 住在Tim Hortons之類的地方，我想讓它成爲你當地的地方，但就像一些 是的，我會住在這裏，你知道我只是在吸毒，或者只是聽Aerosmith的歌 我在戶外，我打賭沒有真正的家，我沒有恐懼，所以對你來說，這是給你的。這是對無家可歸和藥物濫用的憧憬 是啊，你得問問自己，好嗎？ 想想看，這是不是你想要的？ 我不是說想想看，想象一下，這就是等待你的東西 那麼你就有更好的東西可以害怕了，就像害怕一樣 就像我害怕掌握自己的命運一樣 這就是另一種選擇 現在你已經創造了一個現實，你已經創造了一個現實的樣子 所以現在你有東西可以對抗了 是的，完全正確 你需要一部分動力，就是害怕適當的東西 你知道，你可能害怕成功，很公平，你應該更害怕停滯和失敗 但你必須讓這些東西對你來說是真實的，在它們有任何力量之前 是的，在你說話的時候 我甚至意識到，如果我不把最低的 我甚至意識到，如果我不把最低的東西變成現實，如果我不照顧好自己，如果我變成了我最糟糕的樣子，如果我不把它變成現實，它就會讓我更多地停留在迷霧中，因爲現在甚至連結局都沒有，甚至還沒有被創造。我把這一切都留得很模糊，以至於我可以隨便亂走，這就像......這讓我想起了一點，我有一段時間不想戒菸，因爲如果我戒菸，那麼我就必須做一些其他對自己有益的事情，或者我就必須成爲一個不吸菸的人。 不吸菸的人可能會去跑步，或者他可能會喜歡你知道的呃，然後實現不同的目標，所以我意識到有一段時間我沒有戒菸的原因之一是，如果我真的
   因爲如果我對自己誠實的話，我想總是有一個藉口來解釋爲什麼我不能做其他的事情 人們會想知道我們是如何進行對話的 是的，所以也許你可以給我們一些啓示 這是因爲我很好奇 我也很好奇 我從一個朋友那裏知道了你 大約四年前 我想是三年前，我開始聽你說的很多東西，你說的很多東西我一直在想，但我聽到你把它們放到上下文中，我就想那是什麼，那是我在說什麼，那是我想達到的目的，我發現嗯，我想很多都回到了談論自我的問題。 決心，我們已經談了很多關於你的自我 然後你聽到你聽到你看到很多這些線程通過我的書，也許在一個不同的方式在一個更民俗的方式，但很多你說的給了我信心，去我我要把我的故事寫在紙上嗯，所以我感謝你，這就是爲什麼我感謝你在書的後面。我在書的後面提到了你，我想一年半前我曾聯繫過你，你和我聊過天，我和你的女兒保持着聯繫，你知道你的定義，我之前說過的一個偉大的簡單的事情，有時只是爲了重新 我對很多詞都有不同的理解，但我對這兩個詞的理解最深的是脆弱和謙遜，這兩個詞很難懂，很難懂。很奇怪，你說過，如果我引用錯了你的話，請糾正我 謙虛是當你有更多東西要學的時候才知道的 你要麼愛上了你知道的東西，要麼愛上了你不知道的東西 你不知道的東西還有很多，所以要小心選擇你的愛哦 我去了 哦，我買了我的東西，但這是我第一次看到我沒有退縮，我站得更高了 我的心更高了，我的下巴更高了，我的肩膀更靠後了 對，我有更大的勇氣向前走，因爲哦，100 我可以依靠它，直到我離開，甚至更遠 也許比這更遠 是的，我有更多的東西要學，我買了，但現在我可以自信地往前走，看着我所做的，知道我所建立的，我可以增加更多的勇氣，我可以更容易原諒，我可以，我可以用更多的勇氣來承擔責任 嗯，我可以照顧我所建立的東西，用謙卑的理解來更好地參加那些花園 所以，我感謝你，我欣賞這是一種謙卑，這是一種平均形式 最好的方法，教人們批評性思維的最好方法是教他們寫作，我做了這個小東西 我做了這個小東西，放在網上，讓人們瞭解寫作的過程，因爲現在的情況是，教人們寫作非常難，因爲這需要大量的時間，就像寫作一樣，給一篇好的文章打分很容易，檢查一下，你做的都對，給一篇不好的文章打分，哦，我的上帝，單詞是錯的，短語是錯的，句子是錯的，段落順序不對，段落不連貫，整個文章沒有意義，所以想告訴對方他們做錯了什麼。你必須找到他們做得一半正確的幾件小事，你必須教他們做錯了什麼，這真的很昂貴，所以我對這個評分標準所做的是試圖從生產方面而不是評分方面來解決這個問題，但你能做的最好的事情是教人們寫作，因爲這和思考沒有區別。這就像你必須做這項作業，那麼你爲什麼要寫，你需要成績。你絕對是致命的，沒有什麼能阻擋你，所以這就是爲什麼你要學習寫作，這就像，我不能相信人們沒有被告知，這是它，這就像它是你可能提供給別人的最強大的武器，我的意思是，我知道很多人已經被 我的意思是，我認識很多人，他們取得了驚人的成功，在我的一生中，我都在觀察他們，我的意思是，那些人你不要和他們爭論，他們會把你砍成碎片，而且不是惡意的，就像如果你要提出你的觀點，他們要提出他們的觀點，你最好把你的觀點組織起來，因爲否則你會看起來像一個絕對的白癡，你不會有任何進展，如果你能連貫地制定你的論點，做一個演講，如果你能和人們說話，如果你能列出一個建議，上帝人們給你金錢 給你機會，你有影響力，這就是你在大學裏的目的，所以你要做的就是你的工作，你的英語，對，你的新語言，總之就是要教人們口齒伶俐，因爲這是最危險的事情。因爲這是最危險的事情 如果人們知道這一點，就會覺得你爲什麼要學習寫作，因爲這是你的劍，這是你的M16，這是你的防彈衣，你要學會如何使用它們，但是，這對我來說是一個無盡的謎，爲什麼不把它說出來？ 所以這就是那種能讓你發瘋的東西，試圖理清它，就像人們有一個陰謀，把人們帶入教育系統，讓他們變得更弱，所以我想這能讓競爭減少，也許這就是一種思考方式，如果你的學生是愚蠢的，他們就不會去。如果你的學生很笨，他們就不會向你挑戰 當你想到故事的時候，你就會使用故事，而且你講的故事非常有效，當你談到皮諾曹的時候，你使用聖經故事，你是非常有吸引力的故事解釋者和傳播者，當你在講說 當你在寫這本新書的時候，你是怎麼考慮把你的故事或你的信息組成的，以便它們不會丟失，使它們有一些持久性或可傳播性。從1985年到1999年，我每天工作3個小時，我一直在思考，特別是在我20多歲的時候，我每天要思考13個小時，這些想法在我的腦海中奔跑，速度遠遠超過我現在的能力。我試圖弄清楚 我試圖理解惡意 呃，我想除此之外，當我寫最後兩本書時，我 我試圖傳達一些我認爲我學到的東西，所以 例如，當我講課時，我通常在沒有筆記的情況下講課，我心中有一個問題，就像好吧，當在聖經講座中，例如，第一個講座是我認爲大約兩個小時的時間，關於創世紀的第一句話，問題是，這句話是什麼意思？這句話是什麼意思，所以這個講座是對這句話的探索，我試圖把它想清楚，同時我也在傳達這個思考的過程，這就是我在書中所做的，我的書是寫給我的。這就是爲什麼我認爲我已經擺脫了給建議的做法，這些書並不是真正的建議，或者說，如果它們是建議的話，我也屬於需要建議的白癡羣體，所以你知道這些都是我沒有的東西，最後一章是儘管有苦難，也要感恩，你知道我在這方面有真正的掙扎，所以儘管我 我非常清楚地知道，不管是什麼原因造成的怨恨都是沒有效果的，這當然是可以理解的，你知道抓住你剛纔說的話，也許會有一些玄妙的層次，我打算把Victor Frankel的內容塞進去，因爲我我不想給聽衆留下這個懸念。弗朗克談到了完成他的書的願望，這是讓他度過集中營的意義來源之一，你的書是否也是如此，我不知道在過去的18到24個月裏，你在這本書上工作的時間線是否有類似的目的，絕對絕對，這是生命的筏子，當我完成它時，我被摧毀了，這是常見的經驗，你知道是人，這說明了人類動機的本質，我們經常認爲一旦我到了B點，就是你要去的地方，一切就都好了。你需要一個新的B點，所以這真的是......因爲我不在大學工作了，也沒有臨牀實踐了，所以這些都是我的損失，我有這本書，在我病得很重的時候，我把自己固定下來，這很寶貴，現在也是如此。我想問你關於 "超越秩序 "這個標題的問題，但在這之前，我只是埋下一個種子，我想問你這個問題，我的一個朋友，我的幾個朋友想讓我問一些問題，我想聽聽你的答案，那就是如何 如果某人在某一領域達到了能力的頂峯或高水平的能力，你會建議他思考意義或構建或尋找意義嗎？ 我有個朋友，我不說他的名字，因爲我不知道他是否願意公開這個問題，但我問過他這個問題的某個版本，他說好吧，在某些時候，你要麼找到上帝，要麼生孩子，生孩子更容易，所以我生了孩子，這說明了我們之前討論的問題。
   生活在某種程度上是很簡單的 找到一個伴侶並和他們在一起 你知道這很難，如果你能做到的話，試着把自己變成更好的人 這是一個挑戰 有了孩子，有了孫子 感謝上帝，我有了孫子 感謝上帝，我有了孩子 他們是他們，他們是他們，他們是無可置疑的美德 所以，如果你很幸運的話 幸運的是，你還有其他的項目，而且你足夠健康，可以承擔這些項目 關於人們應該如何尋找意義的問題，我做的第一件事，就像我對我的客戶說的那樣，就是我對他們的生活進行掃描，我們在一開始你介紹我的時候就提到了，我有一個程序，在selfauthoring的自我創作。 它可以幫助人們解決這個問題，幫助你寫一本自傳，找出你是誰，幫助你評估你的個性特徵，積極的和消極的，然後它幫助你制定一個未來的計劃，人們發現這很有用，所以概念化自己的一種方式不是作爲秩序，不是作爲混亂，而是作爲穿越這兩個領域之間的東西，我想說這是 我想說的是，這就是神話中的英雄，所以我要開始和你談論皮諾曹，有點奇怪，我希望你喜歡這個，嗯，我之所以要這樣做，是因爲我想，我想把一些，我想把我告訴你的抽象的東西帶到地上，然後你可以開始思考，我介紹給你的概念，它們是否有什麼好處，它們是否有助於，這是秩序的下降到混亂的重新 秩序的建立 這就是失去的天堂 褻瀆的歷史 天堂的重獲 這就是經典的喜劇 這就是生活的故事 所以問題是你如何管理它 所以這是一個你很想知道答案的問題 所以你會去 你會奇怪地付錢 你會排隊付錢去看一個關於這個的故事 即使你甚至不知道這個故事是關於什麼的 原因是實際上你的一部分確實知道這個故事是關於什麼的 你知道你有莫 你的認知有多個層次 你理解的東西 你瞭解你不知道的事情 你瞭解你不瞭解的方式，你可以告訴你，因爲你知道我們我們談到了皮諾曹的一點，它是多麼的荒謬，這並不重要。就像一個暗示，因爲傑佩託是個雕刻家，影片以這首歌開始，這首歌實際上是一首很流行的歌曲，有點像你說的那樣，我不認爲它的詩歌特別深刻，但它是一首人們喜歡的歌，人們仍然在聽。它爲電影定下了基調 這就是音樂的作用 關於電影，有一件事非常有趣，非常神祕 你知道如果你去看電影，幾乎都有原聲帶 如果你去看電影，沒有原聲帶，感覺很空虛 感覺好像少了點什麼 你知道這就像音樂 你知道當你去看電影時，有很多東西你看不見 音樂似乎提供了情感背景，複雜的背景，可以說它就像背景的替代品，它引導你對電影的看法，給你提示將要發生的事情，有趣的是，我們只是我們沒有任何問題，你知道，就像是的，電影當然有配樂，當然，當有一個戲劇性的場景，音樂會變得很戲劇化，但這不會發生在現實生活中，所以你會想爲什麼我們會在電影中接受它。我想部分原因是我們願意接受電影中對現實的放大，事實上我們覺得這很有說服力，而音樂是放大的東西之一，是戲劇化的東西，這對我們來說可以接受。這首歌我覺得很有趣 所以我打算把它拆開來聽 從某種意義上說，我覺得這樣做很愚蠢 因爲它是一首幼稚的歌 在某些方面是一首幼稚的歌 但沒關係，當你向星星許願時，你是誰並不重要 好吧，還有一些謎團 人們向星星許願，就像一個小儀式 爲什麼他們要這麼做呢？ 什麼是星星，這是另一個問題 因爲有星星在天上閃耀，也有人是星星 爲什麼有人是星星呢？ 他們通常是名人，對嗎？ 他們是吸引很多人注意的人 也許有些人有很多天賦，這是另一種可能性 也許他們是模特 我不是說你知道服裝模特，雖然有時他們是模特 這就是成爲明星的意義 這就是爲什麼《人物》雜誌上到處都是明星 他們就像是被帶到人間的英雄 當然你對他們一無所知 你所知道的只是他們的公衆形象 當然他們通常很有吸引力 這樣你就可以在他們身上投射出所有理想人性的東西 所以他們是明星，但爲什麼是明星呢？ 明星在黑暗中招手，他們是另一個世界的人 這是最酷的事情，他們不屬於這個世界，我是說 從技術上講，因爲它們顯然不屬於地球 但我也是說，從現象上講，它有人類經驗的成分 所以你們大多數人都是城市人，所以你們沒有經歷過完整的夜空 你知道，這真的很糟糕，因爲完整的夜空是一種經驗，它能自然地引起敬畏 你知道，難怪你抬頭看，到處都是星星 你在看銀河系的邊緣，實際上那是銀河系的邊緣，對，是銀河系的邊緣 就像哇，那是銀河系的邊緣，有那麼多的星星，這是很有意義的，你在看着無限，你在看着未知，你在看着超越你自己，這是肯定的，你知道這讓人們產生一種敬畏感，就像看着大峽谷或類似的東西。大峽谷或類似的東西，你在看一些超越自己的東西，但這種敬畏感似乎是我們反應的一個自然部分，你知道當你遇到一個你認爲特別令人欽佩的人時，你可能會感到敬畏 因爲你覺得他們有一些超凡脫俗的東西，所以有一件有趣的事情要想一想，有些人你敬佩，有些人你不敬佩，這是一個線索，對，這是一個關於你的價值體系的線索，它可能是 它可能不是你可以用手指指的，就像你覺得這個人很吸引人，你覺得這個人很值得欽佩，就像你內心有一個東西在尋找什麼是值得欽佩的，你知道，假設你是，那個值得欽佩的人 有一種能力，一些你希望自己擁有的能力，所以他們是模仿的榜樣，這也是人們發展的一部分，你知道就像小孩子經常對年長的孩子產生小英雄的迷戀，你知道不是那麼年長，而是那種在他們掌握之中的人，然後他們跟隨他們，模仿他們，你知道，所以他們在模仿他們認爲令人欽佩的東西，你發現一些令人欽佩的事實是對你無意識的價值系統結構的暗示，所以你可以想，甚至作爲練習，你可以想 作爲一個練習，你可以想，我覺得一個人的什麼品質是值得欽佩的，你必須問自己，從某種意義上說，你不能真的去想它，問自己一個問題和思考它之間是有區別的，因爲它更像是當你問自己一個問題時，它是沉思的，就像我覺得什麼是值得欽佩的，是你不知道的問題，如果你很幸運，這經常發生，答案會從地獄般的答案浮現出來，哦，是，這是一個，你可以寫下來 你可以把它寫下來，你就知道你的理想是什麼了 你有一個可能，你的反面理想是星星 對着星星許願就是把你的眼睛舉到地平線以上，關注超越你的東西，關注絕對的東西 我們可以說關注在黑暗中閃耀的光芒，就像星星一樣 人們佩戴鑽石是因爲它們像星星或者像太陽，它們純潔完美，它們閃閃發光，所以也有一些關於光的東西，關於光源的東西，它是 它是照明和啓蒙的來源，然後，在黑暗中閃耀的光是一個深刻的比喻，對，它是它是你想要的，你想要一束光在黑暗中閃耀，所以星星擁有所有這些，所以人們對星星許願，因爲他們有一些 所以人們對着星星許願，因爲他們有一種直覺，認爲超越世俗的目標有可能改變自己，他們許下了一個願望，如果你要許願，你應該瞄準一些高的東西，即使只是瞄準，也更有可能使願望成真，這不是隱喻，你知道我有這個 我有一個項目，你們要做的叫未來創作項目，有兩個作業，一個是寫自傳，這是過去的創作，另一個是寫未來的計劃，這是未來的創作，我建議你們現在就開始寫，不是現在，而是很快，因爲它們比你們想象的要難，有些人要寫15000字，你們會被吸進去，這經常發生，你們會被吸進去，所以你們寫一個 自傳，因爲你需要知道你現在在哪裏，你是誰，因爲除非你知道你在哪裏，否則你怎麼可能規劃出一條通往未來的道路，然後你需要寫出未來，因爲除非你瞄準它，否則你不可能打到什麼東西。這是肯定的，很多時候人們不會瞄準他們想要的東西，因爲他們害怕，他們害怕的原因是，如果你指定了你想要的東西，你就指定了你失敗的條件，你知道當你失敗的時候，最好是保持模糊，就像我不知道我是否成功或
   我不知道我是成功了還是失敗了，但你知道我真的無法判斷，好吧，除了你無法擊中任何你沒有瞄準的東西，所以未來創作問題程序就像一個，它試圖讓你闡明你的性格，過去創作程序也是如此，你是誰，你知道過去創作程序，要求你把你的生活分爲 然後寫下你的情感，你知道你認爲重要的事情，塑造了你自己，你知道你可能會發現其中的一些事情，一些寫作讓你情緒激動，我會說，如果你有一個超過18個月的記憶，大致上說，當你把它帶入腦海，它有一個情感影響。尤其是負面的情緒影響，就像你的靈魂的一部分被卡在那裏，我知道這是一種比喻性的思考方式，但我的意思是，你之所以還在經歷這種情緒，是因爲你還沒有解決那個情況下面臨的問題，這可能是一個真正的問題，比如你和一個非常糟糕的人糾纏在一起。可能是一個真正的問題，比如你和一個非常壞的人糾纏在一起，這很難辦，因爲你得想出一個惡意的理論來處理這樣的事情，這不是開玩笑的，但如果它仍然產生情緒，這意味着你還沒有解決這個問題，你的大腦仍然把它標記爲威脅，這是你的領土的一部分，你沒有掌握威脅，威脅，威脅。除非你把它拆開來，讓它說清楚，讓它寫清楚，否則你就無法從它的控制中解脫出來，而這可能並不那麼令人愉快 我的意思是，這是一種情況，在短期內，人們的情緒會有所下降，但三到六個月後會有很大的改善。你知道，通常情況下，爲了進步，你不得不做一些你不想做的事情，這是非常非常普遍的，所以未來創作程序會問你關於你生活的不同層面，因爲你知道你可以把自己看作是你頭腦中的一個人格，但是你被嵌套在超越你的系統中，它們和任何東西一樣真實。它們和你腦子裏的東西一樣真實。 你的生活需要什麼呢？ 其實很簡單，一些朋友是好東西，親密關係是好東西，家庭你知道，要麼是你要生產的，要麼是你來自的，人們在某種程度上相互關愛，這是一個好東西。你需要爲你的事業制定一些計劃，你必須適應人們認爲重要的地方，他們會與你進行交易，這樣你才能生活下去，你需要在你不工作的時候做一些有意義的事情，你需要注意你的心理和身體健康，你需要調節你對物質的使用，這很奇怪。這很奇怪，但酒精會讓很多人陷入困境，所以值得考慮，這也是我們把它放在這裏的原因，然後就像好吧，你到底想要什麼，你想從你的朋友那裏得到什麼，你想從你的家庭得到什麼，你想從你的事業中得到什麼，如果你能得到你想要的東西，這就是這個項目問你的三到五年後的情況。我假設你們會像合理的成年人一樣對待這個問題，而不是像13歲的夢想家一樣，我想擁有世界上最昂貴的遊艇，這很好，但你知道這不是真正的，它應該是更集中於你的性格，所以它要求你寫15分鐘，不要考慮 太多關於語法或句子結構的東西，寫出你的生活在三到五年後會是什麼樣子，如果你把自己當成你關心的人，你幫助他們找出他們想要的東西，然後它要求你做同樣的事情，反過來說，就是思考你根本不充分的方式 你是假的，每個人都知道這一點 我想你知道，也許不是，但每個人都有一種感覺，如果他們要墮落，他們會怎麼做 有些人是個酒鬼，有些人是個流浪漢 就像有一些厄運的東西在那裏，上面有你的名字 如果你特別不謹慎，你知道不要讓事情發生 所以我想讓你寫一下，你不希望在三到五年內發生什麼事情，這有心理學上的原因，比如說，如果你有什麼目標，那就是積極情緒的來源，因爲你的積極情緒主要是由你在向你重視的東西前進的證據產生的，而不是由完成東西產生的。因爲當你完成某件事情時，你就會面臨接下來要做什麼的問題 所以你從大學畢業時，就像你知道萬歲，有一天你正處於大學生涯的頂峯，第二天你就失業了，在星巴克找一份糟糕的工作，所以你知道，你明白我的意思嗎？你知道，你解決了一個問題就會被另一個問題所取代 所以當你解決了所有的問題後，你就會很開心的想法 就像那個理論一樣，祝你好運 但是你知道，如果你的目標是有價值的，你真的相信它是有價值的，你已經想清楚了 你知道，這樣你就不會軟弱了 你不軟弱，你已經有了你該死的論據，那麼當你取得進展時，哪怕是一點點，你都會覺得嘿，這很好，你會得到一點刺激，一點多巴胺的刺激，這就是你想要的，因爲這就是你的積極情緒的來源，如果你想，你可以使用可卡因，但你知道這往往會有相對不利的中長期的後果 所以你必須要有目標，而且你的目標應該是現實的，你想要的，你可以得到的，比如說不容易得到的，因爲如果它很容易，在某種意義上你已經得到了，它就會推動你，這就是快樂的一部分。因爲當你追求重要的東西時，有兩件事是你想做的，其中之一是得到重要的東西，但另一個是讓自己在追求東西的過程中做得更好，所以你可以同時得到這兩件事，你的目標是什麼，你在提高 你的能力，這就像一筆好買賣，這是一筆好買賣，有很多內在的意義可以感受到，然後程序的後半部分，你寫出一個計劃，說明你要怎麼做，你要怎麼保持自己的軌道，你要寫出爲什麼你這樣做會對你有好處？你要寫出爲什麼你這樣做對你有好處，爲什麼對你的家庭有好處，對社區有什麼可能的好處，你知道，因爲你想把這件事釘死，然後你想弄清楚什麼樣的障礙會出現，你如何克服它們，你如何保持自己的軌道和所有這些。我們知道，因爲我們實際上對這個特別的項目做了很多研究，如果大學生做這個，這更真實，如果他們一開始就沒有太好的方向，如果大學生做這個，他們輟學的可能性就會減少25％，這是一個很大的數字，大約他們的平均分會增加20％。他們的平均成績提高了約20%，所以爲之歡呼，因爲你永遠不知道當你開發一個干預措施時，它是否會起作用，也有證據，但不是來自我的實驗室，做這樣的事情可以改善你的身體健康，我認爲原因是，你知道當你翻閱 你知道，當你翻閱你的自傳，把那些你拖着的負面的地方搜出來，它降低了你的整體壓力負荷，因爲你的大腦有點......我想它在計算這個世界有多危險，通過關注你生活中的成功和失敗的比例，類似的東西。所以你知道，如果你的地圖上有一些洞，你仍然有可能掉進去，那麼你的大腦就會認爲這個地方仍然有點危險，那麼你就會爲緊急行動做好準備，這對你來說很困難，所以你想回到那裏，把這些經驗修復到你無法修復的程度。

what i hope to provide you with is a magic code you know there was a book published a while back tom hanks was in the movie he was a harvard professor who went around solving symbolic mysteries do you remember what was it called the da vinci code everyone liked that it sold a lot and you know it was full of little mysteries and it was full of hints that there was more to the world than you think and which is definitely true and that you know there was a way of getting access to that knowledge and that it would really be worthwhile and people like that they like that idea and the reason for that is because it's actually it's true it's true it's true like like fiction is true so okay let's go back to the guy who's telling you about his morning well he tells you something exciting well then imagine that 10 people tell you something exciting and then you extract out the pattern of them dealing with this problem from that and so then you have a that's what you do if you're an author right because in a in a book you don't want the book exactly to be about what ordinary people do in ordinary times in their life it's like you already know how to be ordinary during ordinary times of your life what that's not useful you know you wouldn't watch a videotape of yourself imagine you videotaped yourself during a day and then the next day you watched that it's like god who would want to do that so what seems to happen in stories is that they distill they distill so they they watch people people watch people and then they tell stories about what they see but they leave a lot out of those stories everything that's boring hopefully and then more and more stories about exciting things get sort of aggregated and then maybe a great writer comes along and writes something really really interesting profound character transformations and then you say well that's fiction and then you say well that's not true because it's fiction but then then maybe that's not right maybe it's more than true because who wants the truth the truth is mundane reality and you've already got that mastered what you want is the distillation of interesting experience and you might think well why is it interesting well that's a really good question because you don't actually know and believe me you really don't know because you'll be interested in things that just don't make any sense at all i'm going to walk you a bit today through pinocchio and we'll do that more the next time too you know but i want to tell you a little bit about that movie to begin with just so you know how crazy you are so you know the plot how many people have seen the disney movie pinocchio okay so lots of people so that's strange enough in itself that so many people have seen it and it's worth thinking about you know you tend to show your kids that movie and but you think about the movie it's you're doing some pretty weird things when you're sitting there watching that movie man first of all it's drawings right and they're low resolution drawings you don't care and you watch the simpsons or maybe or what's that called the the one that's been concentrating on political correctness so much south park god that animation man it's just awful right it's just horrible it couldn't be worse you don't care like round heads smile a little bit of shuffling that's a person as far as you're concerned it's just irrelevant and if it was higher resolution it wouldn't help you just need the bare bones right to hang your perceptions on so so you watch this drawing that's pinocchio beautiful drawings animated in a sequence you're not watching something real you're watching a pure construction and then you think about the plot it's like it's completely absurd everything about it is absurd it's like well one of the characters is a bug and he turns out to be like the conscience and so what the hell is with that and then another character is this puppet marionette and you know somehow he gets free of his strings and then goes on this adventure and then which is and then you know he gets enticed into various nefarious places by a fox and a cat and then he rescues his father from a whale and you don't even know how his father got in the whale it's like the last time you see his father he was in a rainstorm and the next thing that happens is he's in a whale and you're sitting there thinking hey no problem this all makes sense it's like what really why how does that make sense well the answer is you don't know that's the thing that's so cool you don't know you don't even know what you're watching but it doesn't matter you watch it and you're interested in it you want to see what the hell happens to this puppet you want to see if he ends up becoming a real boy because there's it seems important well you say well is pinocchio true well that's a stupid question it's partly a stupid question because the answer is it depends on what you mean by true and it isn't obvious to me what you should mean when you say that something's true and i the reason it's not obvious is because we have this idea in our society and it's it's a very profound idea and that idea is that the ultimate truth is scientific truth that that tells us that about the nature of the world and it does that in in a final way in some sense there's no brooking any arguments about it and the physicists have got it right and that's why they can make hydrogen bombs and that's a pretty good demonstration of their being right but you don't act as if that's true and you don't and you watch things and pay attention to things and are captivated by things that aren't predicated on those assumptions and it seems to me that there is a problem of what the world is made out of but there's a bigger problem and that's the problem of how you should conduct yourself in the world and that's really what you want to know people want to know that more than anything because you need to know it's like here you guys are in university it's like you don't know what you're doing i mean some of you know more than others but you're at the beginning of your life and life is very complex and chaotic and it isn't exactly obvious you know how what kind of relationship you should form or what sort of character you should develop or what you're going to do for a job or how what's the meaning of life that's a good one what's the meaning of life well and you know people come to university at least many of them and that's kind of what they want to find out now paglia her notion is that you could think about it this way is that articulated knowledge is embedded in inarticulate knowledge and inarticulate knowledges the domain of literature and art and and high culture let's say and it's we sort of know what it means but we don't exactly know what it means it means more than we know and then outside of that is what we don't know at all and that's an idea that jung developed as well and maybe paglia picked it up from jung because jung believed that you know there was this domain that we had mastered in every domain and then there were there was a domain outside of that which you could think of as unexplored territory and what we met unexplored territory with was our creative imagination and that what we're trying to do with our creative imagination is to figure out how to deal with that unexplored territory we're producing dramas that we could act out that would help us deal with what we still hadn't mastered and then outside of that there's just what we don't know at all and paglia's idea and this was jung's idea was that without understanding that surround you're too atomized you're not part of your historical tradition you haven't incorporated the spirit of your ancestors who built all this you're you're just here now and and you don't know what to do either and you don't know how to maintain your culture and you don't know how to serve it and you know you might say well why should you serve your culture and well i have a hypothesis about that you know you can think about this i don't know if it's true but people ask what the meaning of life is and it seems to me that meaning is proportionate to the adoption of responsibility you know like let's say you have a little sister who's like three you're going to take care of her like questioning whether that's a good idea just seems stupid you know what i mean it just doesn't seem like the right kind of question it's like well obviously self-evidently let's say that's what you do and you find it meaningful it's like probably you know interacting with a little kid when we when i had little kids you know when they were like two or under we took them out to see their relatives and they were older people and you know they watched that two-year-old like like it was a fire you know every second that that little kid was in the room every single adult was focused on focused on on him or her that's something that people attend to and that's a source of meaning and what else is meaningful well your family relationships are meaningful to you and maybe the responsibility that you adopt as as a friend that that seems meaningful maybe your decision to pursue a particular career and be of some utility in society you know part of that's governed by your desire to establish some security and get ahead it's fine but you're also playing an integral role in the maintenance of the structure that supports you and my observation has been that in my clinical practices that people just have a hell of a time if they don't have if they don't slot in somewhere you know you know you think i gotta go to work at nine in the morning and you know i've got this rigid schedule it's like it's probably a good idea to be grateful for that because what i've noticed is that if people pull out from those externally scaffolded systems they drift they get depressed they get anxious they don't know what to do with themselves you know they're kind of like sled dogs with no sled and we're kind of like sled dogs as far as i can tell beasts of burden like we need a load man we need a load and the question is what what sort of load do you need and here's why i think we need we need that you know there's i've been thinking about how to figure out what's real for a long time and because i'm an existentialist i'm operating under the presupposition that you can tell what people believe by watching what they how they act i don't care what they say i don't care what their statements are about their view of reality because the correlation the relationship between that and their actual actions is not certainly not perfect and sometimes doesn't even exist one thing i've noticed is that people no one argues with their own pain everyone who hurts acts as if they believe that pain is real so we could say the ultimate reality is pain that's how people act it's in keeping with the claims of many religious traditions you know the jews are always recollecting past pain i mean the christian god is a crucified person i mean there's a fair bit of pain there for the buddhists the fundamental maxim is that life is suffering and it seems to me that there's a metaphysical claim there the metaphysical claim is that pain is real now of course it depends on what you mean by real but people act as if their pain is real so that's a good place to start now that poses a problem life is a pain life is suffering let's say and why is that well it's because you can be broken hurt and destroyed and so that seems pretty self-evident and worse you know it and that makes people unique like that's our self-consciousness right that's really what separates us in some sense from other creatures i mean other creatures have some self-consciousness like chimp can learn to recognize itself in a mirror and soak in a dolphin but you know that's pretty that's pretty bare-bones self-consciousness you know real self-consciousness is the knowledge of your borders and not only in space but in time and as far as i can tell human beings are the only creatures that have discovered the future and that's really good because we can plan for the future but it's really bad because you know the future is finite and that's like that's a big shock to the old system and it's the existential burden that everyone bears and it's associated integrally with suffering and so then you think well life is suffering and it's finite and that's part of the suffering that's part of what you makes you question the value of existing and maybe the value of existence itself so then what do you have to use as a weapon against that well you know we talked a little bit about responsibility that seems to work you know the the amount of responsibility that you adopt with really in relationship to things seems to increase your meaningful engagement and you might say well what's the most meaningfully engaged activity and you might say well how about little reduction in the old suffering you know so you live your life so that you're not causing undue pain especially pointless pain that would be good and maybe you could even be more useful than that and you could figure out some ways that some suffering yours other people's both if you're really you know hitting a home run maybe you can figure out some way that some of that could be rectified and that seems to be meaningful in and of itself i mean if it's pain that makes you doubt the meaning of life which is perfectly reasonable then this cessation of pain the cessation of suffering the minimization of suffering as a logical corollary should be the proper medication and so i would say that means that there's some mode that you can conduct yourself in that makes you a good person and part of being a good person is to alleviate suffering and i don't think you get to question that actually if if the suffering itself is what's making you question the validity of your life then you can't also say that the cessation of that is not useful i mean you can but it's completely incoherent you can you can claim incoherent things if you want so then i would say these distilled stories that i'm talking about the stories that are written say by great authors i'm particularly fond of dostoevsky who's whose works are he's head and shoulders above anyone i've ever read in terms of writers of fiction he deals with the hardest questions that human beings face and he he has characters on both sides of the argument and they're they really lay out the arguments it's not like dostoevsky you know he's got a belief and so he has a character and that character has his beliefs and that character always wins the arguments that doesn't happen in the dostoevsky novel at all he sets up a character and then he sets up like three or four antagonists and those antagonists they're not straw men they're like iron giants they just stomp his his protagonist you know and the whole thing is a war between these different conceptions of being and it's amazing to see it's amazing to read so you distill these stories great authors distilled stories great storytellers distilled stories and we have stories that are very very very very old those are usually religious stories of one form or another but they can be fairy tales because fairy tales some people have traced fairy tales back you know more than ten thousand years and so they're part of an oral tradition and oral traditions can last for tens of thousands of years and you know it's a story that's been told for ten thousand years is a funny kind of story it's like people have remembered it and and obviously modified it it's like the game of telephone you know where i tell you something and you whisper it to the person next to you and so on it's like a game of telephone that's gone on for you know a thousand generations and all that's left is what people remember and maybe they remember what's important because you tend to remember what's important and it isn't necessarily the case that you know what the hell it means you don't know what music means but you know it doesn't stop you from listening to it you don't know generally speaking what a movie that you see or a book that you read means not if it's profound it means more than you can understand because otherwise why read it well so the idea is this is that we're necessarily nested inside moral systems the moral systems are predicated on narratives narrative dramas of sorts and the moral systems are what orient us in life and the reason to understand them to the degree that you can is because you need to know how to live nietzsche said that if you had a a y you could bear any how and that's that's good learn to write i'm dead serious like i'm dead serious about that because writing is formalized thinking and so the way you write is first of all you need a problem because why write if you don't have a problem so this is good advice if you're just writing an essay by the way for your classes it's like pick a bloody problem that you want to write about because otherwise it's false right from the start it's up to you to engage with the material until you find something that grips you that you desire to investigate okay so you need a problem well the next thing you need to do is we need to have something to say about the problem also reading reading is really good for that read as much as you can get your hands on that addresses the problem okay so now now you now you know a bunch of things or at least provisionally know them you at least have access to them well now you start you start sorting through it's like okay well maybe i need to summarize what i've learned and then i need to iron out the contradictions between what i've learned and i need to elegantly formulate that and i need to get my word choice right and my phrase choice right and my sentence choice right and i need to organize the sentences into proper paragraphs and the paragraphs into proper sequence so that i have a coherent argument and at the same time what you're doing is is you're you're you're you're um you're integrating your own personality at the highest and most abstract level of organization and you're sharpening your tools and you're putting yourself straight because you're learning to think you learn to do that by writing and so i would say pick some hard problems and learn to write very very carefully and and when i say pay attention to the word i mean that pick the right words organize them into the right phrases get your sentences straight like when i wrote my first book maps of meaning i believe i wrote every sentence in that book 50 times 50 variants of every sentence i'd read it once i'd read it again i'd read it again i'd write it again and i have a little competition which sentence is better which sentence is better i'd pick that sentence do the same with the paragraphs over many many years you hone your words they're the most powerful thing about you bar none if you're an effective writer and speaker and communicator you you have all the authority and competence that there is and so you're at university maybe you're taking humanities degree well that what's the humanities degree for it's to teach you how to think you learn to think by writing now there's more to read to speak and all of that but the best thing you can do is read and write every day couple of hours every day write about things you find important and see if you can see if you can discover what you believe to be true and that'll build you a foundation and it's unbelievably practical like if you look at people who are phenomenally successful across life there's various reasons but one of them is is that they're unbelievably good at articulating what they what they're aiming at and strategizing and negotiating and and and and enticing people with a vision forward it's like get your words together man that's that makes you unstoppable and that that's really that's the core of the humanities that idea get your words together make yourself an articulate creature and then you're you're deadly in the best possible way so and take that seriously and i'll end with something too you students you might think in your more cynical moments that you have to offer your professors what they want and gerrymander the content of your language to suit their predilections or what you consider to be their predilections first of all it's a very small minority of professors who are corrupt enough to punish you for producing a high quality essay that they don't agree with and and though that's reprehensible but it doesn't happen very often but more importantly it's it's uh it's the highest academic sin to do that because what you're here to do is to learn to find your true voice and every time you deviate from that for expedient reasons you corrupt yourself and not in a trivial way because when you formulate your arguments that that becomes a permanent part of your character you carry that with you it becomes part of the structure through which you view the world and it guides your actions and so you hold your words pristine and you work in a dedicated way to become as articulate and clear as you can possibly become and there's nothing that's more practical and noble than that at the same time that's why the humanities are so valuable you know you think well what good is a humanities degree it's like well you come out of here able to speak and think and write no matter where you go like you're you're headed for for the pinnacle and hopefully in a in a way that's positive for everyone so that's what i would recommend i'm a great admirer of the humanities like and of the universities i mean the humanities you learn to be a citizen through the humanities the humanities are at the core of western culture if they go we're in trouble so the problem is is that what's manifesting itself as the humanities in the universities is no longer the humanities it's something almost virtually the opposite of that and so and so when i tell people not to go to humanities courses in the universities it's with a very heavy heart believe me you know now the question is where do you go instead well that's a good question you can always read you know one of the things that's really cool about amazon is all the great books are free they're literally free you can go download them on your kindle for nothing the copyrights has expired and people have been putting electronic versions online so the great books of the western world and even many of the great books of the 20th century are now available completely for free well so you can read them there's lots of information to be garnered now on youtube and that's really going to explode over the next 10 years and i mean one of the things i want to work on probably over the next 10 years is to set up a humanities university online and i'm starting to work i already have some programs online they're called self-authoring programs and they help people write and partly we designed them to help people learn to write as well as to help them write about themselves so the self-authoring programs help people write an autobiography and analyze their personality faults and virtues and lay out a future for themselves and when we've had students do that do the future authoring program it's so cool what happened was that their the probability that they would stay in school went up by about 30 percent but something even cooler happened it worked best for the worst performing students so we did a lot of it in holland at a business school called erasmus uh there's a there's a school of management rodderman rotterdam school of management at erasmus university and we run several i think it's about 10 000 people through the future authoring program now and what happened if you looked at the academic performance of the students the dutch women the native dutch women were at the pinnacle and then it was the dutch men below them now the women were in a minority and they were probably a little more highly selected right so maybe that accounted for the performance gap and then underneath that there was female non-western ethnic minority immigrants and then below that were male non-western ethnic minority immigrants and there was a massive gap between the dutch women and the male non-western minority immigrants like a performance gap of about 80 percent a massive gap within two years after writing the future authoring program the male non-ethnic western minority students passed the dutch students yeah and some of them didn't even remember that they had done the future authoring exercise and we replicated that at mohawk college just a while back same thing the young men who went to mohawk college they did this exercise in the summer just before they went to college they only took about an hour to write out their future it's not that long to think about your whole future and what happened was that the young men who had the worst grades in school who were in non-career-oriented trajectories had a retention improvement of about 40 percent so yeah so that was just like we're just thrilled about that so so the reason i'm telling you all of this story apart from the fact that it's vaguely interesting is that um we are experimenting with technologies to teach people how to write now normally the way you're taught how to write is by having someone edit your writing but that's prohibitively expensive i don't think it it can be transformed in something that's available on a mass basis and so what we're trying to do is to break down the process of writing into its requisite steps that's kind of what behavioral psychologists do we've done that already a bit with these with this essay writing format and then to to sort of teach people what the mechanics of writing actually are and then maybe to try to figure out how to crowdsource editing so that many many people can participate in the process but we'd like to set up an online humanities university over the next 10 years and since the universities have abandoned their intellectual property there's no reason not to just move in and take it as far as i can tell you know my colleagues and i developed this program online to help people do that to write through their life so it the past authoring program helps people write an autobiography who the hell am i anyways and you think you know but you don't because you're complicated and then the present authoring program helps you identify your faults and your virtues by your own definition it's not imposed on you it's it's a guided process of exploration and then the future authoring program helps you figure out well if you could have what you wanted well hypothetically what would that actually be and yes it's very much worth asking yourself that question because you're always searching for that anyways even negatively because your conscience will torment you for the things you're not doing okay while not doing in relationship to what well in relationship to the implicit ideal of your conscience well what is that and the answer is well you don't know and so if you're just allowing yourself to be tortured into submission then you're at the mercy of some ideal that you don't know you don't and maybe you wouldn't want to pursue if you actually knew you know that's why junk carl jung said everyone lives out a myth but virtually no one knows which what myth they're living and maybe it's a tragedy maybe you don't want it to be a tragedy and then the question what do you want that's a really deep question you know i mean you that's a serious question what is it that you should value and people say well being happy they don't even mean that by the way if you decompose what people mean when they say they want to be happy what it turns out they actually mean is they don't want to be miserable they're way more concerned with avoiding suffering than they are with pursuing you know enthusiastic positive emotion so even the the statement i want to be happy is actually not an accurate reflection of what it is that you want does that not show just how little of our own motivations we get to see we're so good at deception that we deceive ourselves before we deceive anybody else we get to see this tiny tiny little sliver of why we are here why we do the things we do why we think the things we think i saw this quote today from robert wright that said emotions are the executioner of our genes or the executor of our genes all that they're there is to just enact what our biological imperative wants and then we get to glimpse them as they run past on the way to doing a thing and we believe that we're somehow we're peering into the source code of our own mind that's not the case well we're definitely not transparent to ourselves by any stretch of the imagination we wouldn't have to spend decades studying psychology if we were transparent like we're we're tremendously mysterious to to ourselves one of the things we do do in the self-authoring program in the future authoring program is say well um if you deteriorated according to your own vices and that went that got out of hand what would that look like five years down the road you know everyone knows some people some people flirt with with alcoholism or drug abuse or um or uh sex addiction yes yes yes that's right fractured relationships even candy whatever and then you know you have a sense in your mind of what you'd be like if you let yourself go oh i'd be sick man i'd be under a bridge or something i'd probably be behind like a i don't know living behind a tim hortons or something you know some type of place i'm trying to make it local to you but like some yeah i'd be living you know i'd just be doing drugs or just probably listening to aerosmith i'd be outdoors i bet no real home i'd have no fear so for you so it's for you it's a vision of homelessness and and substance abuse yeah yeah well you've got to ask yourself like okay think about that is that what you want and i don't i mean think about it imagine that right that's what awaits you well then you have a better thing to be afraid of it's like afraid as i am of of gripping my own destiny here's the alternative right now you've created the now you've created a reality of what that looks like so now you have something to battle against right yes exactly right you need part of part of being motivated is to be afraid of the proper things you know afraid as you might be of success and fair enough it's possible that you should be more afraid of stagnation and failure but you have to make those things real for you before they have any power yeah as you're talking i'm even realizing that if i don't make the the the lowest if i don't make the reality of what could happen if i don't take care of myself and if i were to like devolve and disintegrate into my worst place if i don't make that a reality it almost lets me stay in the fog even more because now even the there's not even the the end hasn't even been created i've left it all just so vague that i can just kind of meander around it's like um it it reminds me a little bit i didn't want to quit smoking for a while because if i quit smoking then i would have to actually then do something else good for myself or i would have to then be a non-smoker and a non-smoker might then go for a run or he might like you know uh then achieve a different goal so one of the reasons i realized for a while that i didn't quit smoking was because if i was real honest with myself i wanted to always have an excuse of why i couldn't do other stuff people are going to wonder how it was that we came to have a conversation yes and so maybe you could shed some light on that and it's because i'm curious i'm curious about it as well i got turned on to you from a friend of mine about four years ago i think three years ago and i started listening to a lot what you were saying and many of the things you you said i had been thinking about but i heard you putting them into words in context i was like what that's that's that's what i'm talking about that's what i'm trying to get to i found um uh i think a lot of goes back to talk about self-determination which we've talked about a lot about your self-authoring and then you hear you hear you see a lot of those threads through my book maybe in a different way in a more folksy way but a lot of what you've said gave me confidence to go i i'm gonna put my story on paper um so i thank you for that and that's why i thank you in the back of the book you know i reached out um to you uh i guess a year and a half ago or so and you and i chatted and i've stayed in contact with you with your daughter um you know your definition one of the great simple things i said earlier sometimes just to re-unders understanding a word differently i've always had trouble in a bad tough relationship an awkward relationship with with many words but my late my two that i've had the longest trouble with are vulnerability and humility yeah these are tough ones they're tough ones so humility i you know okay be humble well for for a few decades be humble i lost confidence when i was humble i i feigned false modesty which i felt which i knew at the time that's arrogant what are you doing right absolutely it's very difficult to be to have humility without being arrogant about it weirdly enough you said you correct me if i if i misquote you it's humility is known when you have more to learn you're either in love with what you know or you're in love with what you don't know and there's a lot more of what you don't know so pick your love carefully oh well that i went oh i purchased i'm in on that but for the first time when i see that i'm not shrinking i'm actually standing taller my heart's higher my chin's higher my shoulders are further back right i have more courage going forward because oh 100 i i can rely on that until i'm gone and maybe even further than that yes i have more to learn i purchase but now i can go forward with confidence of watching what i do know what i have built i can add more courage i can forgive easier i can i can i can take responsibility with more courage um i can take care of the things i've built and to attend those gardens better with with that understanding of humility so for that i thank you i appreciate that it's a humility it's a form of average the best way the best way to teach people critical thinking is to teach them to write and i made this little thing that i put online it's it steps people through the process of writing because what's happened now it's very hard to teach people to write because it's unbelievably time intensive and like writing marking a good essay that's really easy check a you did everything right right marking a bad essay oh my god the words are wrong the phrases are wrong the sentences are wrong they're not ordered right in the paragraphs the paragraphs aren't coherent and the whole thing makes no sense so trying to tell the person what they did wrong it's like well you did everything wrong everything about this essay is wrong well that's not helpful either you have to find the few little things they did half right and you have to teach them what they did wrong it's really expensive and so what i did with this rubric was try to address that from the production side instead of the grading side but the best thing you can do is teach people to write because there's no difference between that and thinking and one of the things that just blows me away about universities is that no one ever tells students why they should write something it's like well you have to do this assignment well why are you writing well you need the grade it's like no you need to learn to think because thinking makes you act effectively in the world thinking makes you win the battles you undertake and those could be battles for good things if you can think and speak and write you are absolutely deadly nothing can get in your way so that's why you learn to write it's like and i can't believe that people aren't just told that it's it's it's like it's the most powerful weapon you can possibly provide someone with and i mean i know lots of people who've been staggeringly successful and watched them throughout my life i mean those people you don't want to have an argument with them they'll just slash you into pieces and not in a malevolent way it's like if you're going to make your point and they're going to make their point you better have your points organized because otherwise you're going to look like and be an absolute idiot you are not going to get anywhere and if you can formulate your arguments coherently and make a presentation if you can speak to people if you can lay out a proposal god people give you money they give you opportunities you have influence that's what you're at university for and so that's what you do is you that's you're in you're in english right you're in yeah new languages anyways it's like yeah teach people to be articulate because that's the most dangerous thing you can possibly be so and that's motivating if people know that it's like well why are you learning to write because you're here's your sword here's your m16 right here's your bulletproof vest like you learn how to use them but ah it's just it's an endless mystery to me why that isn't made self-evident so that's the sort of thing that can drive you mad trying to sort out it's like people are there's a there's a conspiracy to bring people into the education system to make them weaker so i guess that keeps the competition down maybe that's one way of thinking about it if your students are stupid they're not going to challenge you when you think of stories and you use stories and you tell stories very effectively when you talk about say pinocchio you use biblical stories you're very engaging sort of interpreter and transmitter of stories when you're working on say beyond order this new book how do you think of composing your stories or your messages so that they are not lost so that they have some durability or transmissibility well i'm always mostly when i'm writing i'm trying to figure something out although as i've written for as the period of time over which i've been writing has lengthened i'm spending more time communicating the ideas and less time figuring them out when i wrote my first book which was maps of meaning pretty much all i was doing was trying to figure something out it was just an exercise in sustained thought and i worked on it for from 1985 to 1999 about three hours a day and i thought about it especially when i was in my 20s all the time i was thinking about it like 13 hours a day and the ideas were just running through my mind at a rate far higher than i'm capable of now um i was trying to figure something out i was trying to figure out i was trying to understand malevolence uh i suppose among other things but when i wrote the last two books i i was trying to communicate some of what i thought i had learned and so but it's still a lot of it's still trying to solve a to to answer a question when i lecture for example and i usually do that without notes i have a question in mind it's like okay well when in the biblical lectures for example the first one is i think it's about two hours long on the first sentence of genesis the question is well what does this sentence mean and so the lecture is an exploration of what it means and i'm trying to think it through and at the same time i'm communicating that process of thinking it through and that's what i'm doing with my books and i the books are written to me you know which is why i think i've gotten away with giving advice the books aren't really advice or if they are i'm included in the population of idiots who needs the advice so you know these are things i haven't there's a the last chapter is be grateful in spite of your suffering you know i've had real struggle with that so although i know perfectly well that resentment regardless of the cause is not productive it's certainly understandable you know grabbing what you just said and maybe going to a somewhat meta level i am going to shoehorn in victor frankel because i i don't want to leave that loose end for for listeners i frankel talks about the desire to finish his book as one of the sources of meaning that got him through the concentration camps did did your book and i don't know the timeline for having worked on it serve a similar purpose over the last 18 to 24 months absolutely absolutely it was life raft i was i was devastated when i finished it which is common experience you know be people and it speaks to the nature of human motivation we often think well once i get to point b that's where you're headed everything will be okay it's like no that's not the case at all is that now you need a new point b so and that was really you know because i don't work at the university anymore and i don't have my clinical practice anymore and um so that those are losses to of structure for me and i have the book to anchor myself while i was so ill and it was invaluable and still is for that matter i want to ask you about the title beyond order but before i get to that i'm just planting the seed i'd love to ask you this is a question that a friend of mine several friends of mine wanted me to ask some version of and i would like to hear your answer and that is how would you recommend someone think about meaning or constructing or finding meaning if they have reached the pinnacle of competence or a high level of competence in a certain area i have a friend i won't name him because i don't know if he would want this public but i i asked him some version of this and he said well at some point you have to either find god or have kids and having kids is easier so i had kids well that speaks to what we discussed earlier it's like there's many domains in which to obtain competence you can find a new domain but kids for sure that's like look life is quite straightforward in some ways find a partner and stick with them you know that's hard try to make yourself into better people if you can it's a challenge have kids have grandkids thank god i have grandkids thank god i have kids you know they they they're they're they're that's an that they're of unquestionable virtue and so then if you're lucky you have other projects and and you're healthy enough to to undertake them um with regards to how people should search for meaning well it's the first thing i do like i said with my clients is i do uh on a scan of their life and we have you mentioned it at the beginning when you introduced me i have a program a self authoring at selfauthoring.com that helps people with this it helps you write an autobiography sort of figures out who you are it helps you assess your personality traits positive and negative and then it it helps you make a plan for the future and people have found that useful so one way of conceptualizing yourself is not as order and as not as chaos but as the thing that traverses between the two domains and that i would say is the mythological hero so i'm going to start talking to you about pinocchio a little bit weirdly enough i hope you enjoy this um and the reason i want to do it is because i want to i want to put some i want to bring what i told you abstractly down to earth and then you can start thinking well do the conceptions that i've introduced to you are they are they good for anything do they help that's the order descent into chaos re-establishment of order that's paradise lost profane history paradise regained it's the classic comedy and that's the story of life and so the question is how do you manage it and so that's a question you really want to know the answer to so you'll go you'll pay money weirdly you'll line up and pay money to see a story about that even if you don't even know that that's what the story is about and the reason for that is that actually part of you does know what the story is about you know you have mo your cognition has multiple layers you understand things that you don't know you understand in ways that you don't understand and you can tell that because you know we we talked about pinocchio a little bit how absurd it is and that it doesn't matter so the movie opens with the opening credits which are carved wooden signs which is like a hint you know because geppetto's a carver and it starts with this song which was actually quite a popular song and it's a bit of a what would you call it i don't think it's the poetry is particularly profound but it was a song that people liked and people still listen to and um it sets the tone for the movie which is what music does one of the things that's really interesting about movies that's really mysterious is that you know if you go to a movie there's almost always a soundtrack right if you go to a movie and there isn't a soundtrack it kind of feels empty it feels like there's something missing and you know it's as if the music you know when you go to a movie there's lots of things you can't see the characters are only partial and you don't know anything about their background so it's like a low resolution thing what seems to happen with the music is that it provides the emotional background the complex context let's say it's like a substitute for the context and it it guides you in in your in your perceptions of the movie it gives you hints about what's going to happen and and and the funny thing about that is is that we just we just don't have any problem with that you know it's like yeah of course movie has a soundtrack and and of course when there's a dramatic scene the music gets dramatic and but that doesn't happen in real life so you'd wonder why we would accept it in a movie and i think it's partly because we're willing to accept the amplification of reality that constitutes a movie and in fact we find that compelling and music is one of the things that does that amplification the dramatization and that's that's acceptable to us this song i find quite interesting so i'm going to take it apart quite a bit um in some sense i feel foolish doing it because it's you know it's a it's a childish it's a childish song in some ways but but that's okay when you wish upon a star makes no difference who you are well okay there's some mysteries there people wish upon stars that's like a little ritual right why do they do that well and what exactly is a star that's another question because there are stars that shine in the heavens and there are people who are stars and so why are people stars well they're usually famous people right they're people that who attract a lot of attention and maybe there are people who have a lot of talent that's another possibility maybe they're models i don't mean you know clothing models although sometimes they are but they're models for emulation that's what being a star means that's why people magazine is full of stars it's like they're they're like they're like heroes brought to earth and of course you know nothing about them all you know is their public persona and of course they're usually very attractive and so that allows you to project upon them all the things that would go along with ideal humanity and so they're stars and but still why stars well stars beckon in the darkness right and they're otherworldly that's the thing that's cool they're not of this earth and i mean that technically because obviously they're not of this earth but i also mean it i mean it phenomenologically i mean it has an element of human experience so most of you are urban and so you've not had the experience of perhaps of the full night sky you know and that's really too bad because the full night sky is one of those experiences that actually induces awe naturally you know and no wonder you look up there and there's just stars everywhere right you're looking at the edge of the galaxy that's actually that's the milky way right it's the edge of the galaxy it's like wow there's the edge of the galaxy and there's just so many of them and it's such an expense you're looking into infinity you're looking into the unknown you're looking beyond yourself that's for sure and you know that produces a sense of awe in people like looking at the grand canyon or something like that and it's you're looking at something that transcends yourself but that feeling of awe that seems to be something that's that's that's a natural part of our response you know you might feel aw when you meet someone that you regard as particularly admirable as well because you feel that there's something transcendent about them so here's an interesting thing to think about there are people you admire and there are people that you don't admire and that's a clue right that's a clue as to your value system and it might be not really something you can even put your finger on it's like you you find this person captivating you find this person admirable and it's as if there's something inside of you that's looking for what's admirable you know assuming that you are and that person who's admirable has a has a faculty some faculty that you would like to have for yourself and so they're a model for emulation and that's part of how people develop you know like little kids often develop little hero crushes on older kids you know not that much older but sort of the person that's sort of just within their grasp and then they follow them around and imitate them and you know so they're imitating what they find admirable well the fact that you find something admirable is a hint as to the structure of your unconscious value system and so you could think even as an exercise you could think well what qualities of a human being do i find admirable you have to ask yourself that in a sense you can't really think about it there is a difference between asking yourself a question and thinking about it you know because it's more like when you're asking yourself a question it's contemplative it's like well what do i find admirable it's question you don't know and if you're fortunate and this happens quite regularly an answer will float up from wherever the hell answers float up and oh yeah that's one and you can write that down and you get some idea of what your ideal is you know and you have one likely and what your counter ideal is star well to wish upon a star is to raise your eyes above the horizon and to focus on something transcendent that's beyond you to focus on the absolute we could say to focus on the light that shines in the darkness now as stars people wear diamonds because they're like stars or they're like the sun and they're pure and perfect and they glitter and so there's something about the light too there's something about a source of light it's a source of illumination and enlightenment and then and the light that shines in the darkness is a deep metaphor right it's it's it's it's what you want you want a light to shine in the darkness and so the star has all that and so people wish upon a star because they have some intuition that aiming above the mundane has the potential to transform themselves they make a wish well if you're gonna make a wish you should aim at something high and even just aiming at that is more likely to make the wish come true and this is not metaphor you know i have this program which you guys are going to do called the future authoring program is one of two assignments one is that you write an autobiography that's the past authoring the other is that you write a plan for the future that's the future authoring i would recommend that you get started on those right now like not right now but like really soon because they're harder than you think and some of you are going to write like 15 000 words you're going to get sucked right in this happens all the time you're going to get sucked right into it and so you write an autobiography because you need to know where you are and who you are right now because how the hell are you going to plot a pathway to the future unless you know where you are and then you need to write about the future because you aren't going to hit something unless you aim at it that's for sure and lots of times people won't aim at what they want because they're afraid the reason they're afraid is because if you specify what you want you've specified your conditions of failure you know when you fail and it's better just to keep it foggy it's like well i don't know if i'm succeeding or failing but you know i can't really tell well great except you can't hit anything you don't aim at and so the future authoring problem program is like a it's an attempt to have you articulate your character and and so is the past authoring program who are you and you know the past authoring program and asked you to break your life into epochs and then to write about the emotional you know the things that you regard as important important events that have shaped who you are and you know you may find that some of those some of that writing makes you emotional and i would say if you have a memory that's more than 18 months old roughly speaking and when you bring it to mind it it has an emotional impact especially a negative emotional impact there's it's like part of your soul is stuck back there and i know that's a metaphorical way of thinking about it but what i mean is that the reason that you still experience the emotion is because you have not solved the problem that that situation faced you with it might be a real problem like maybe you got tangled up with someone who is really bad and that's rough man because you've got to come up with a theory of malevolence to deal with something like that and that's no joke but if it still produces emotion it means you haven't solved the problem and your your brain is still tagging it as threat it's it's a part of your territory that you did not master threat threat threat threat and until you take it apart and articulation really helps that writing really helps that then you're not going to free yourself from its grip and that what might not be that pleasant i mean this is one of those situations where doing it tends to produce a decrement in people's mood in the short term but quite radical improvements three to six months down the road you know it's often the case that you unfortunately have to do something you don't want to do in order to progress it's very very common so and the future authoring program asks you about different dimensions of your life like because you're you know you can think of yourself as a personality inside your head but you're nested in systems that transcend you and they're just as real as whatever's in your head it's like well what do you need for life well that's pretty easy actually some friends that's a good thing intimate relationship that's a good thing family you know either the one you're going to produce or the one that you come from where people to some degree love and care for one another that's a good thing to work on you need you need some plan for your career you've got to fit in somewhere that people regard as important in that they'll trade with you so that you can live you need something worthwhile to do with the time that you're not at work and you need to pay attention to your mental and physical health and you need to regulate your use of substances which is a strange one but alcohol does lots of people in so it's worth it's worth thinking about that's why we put it in there so then it's like okay what the hell do you want what do you want from your friends what do you want from your family what do you want from your career if you could have what you wanted that's what the program asks you three to five years down the road you get to have what you want now i'm assuming that you're going to approach this like you know reasonable adults and not like 13 year old dreamers i think i want the most expensive yacht in the world it's like fine but you know that isn't really what it's supposed to be more concentrating on your character and so then it asks you to write for 15 minutes without thinking too much about grammar or or sentence structure any of that about what your life could be like three to five years down the road if if you were treating yourself like someone you cared for and you were helping them figure out what they wanted and then it asks you to do the same thing in reverse which is to think about the ways that you're radically insufficient and you're false and everyone knows this i think you know maybe not but everyone has a sense of if they were going to degenerate how they would do it you know some people would be an alcoholic some people would be a street person it's like there's some doom thing out there that's got your name on it if you're particularly uncautious and you know don't and let things fall apart so i want you to write about that what do you not want to have happen in three to five years and there's psychological reasons for this say one is if you have something to aim for that's a source of positive emotion because your positive emotion is mostly generated by evidence that you're moving towards something that you value it's not generated so much by accomplishing something because when you accomplish something you're just left with the problem of whatever you're going to do next so you graduate from university it's like you know hooray one day you're at the peak of your undergraduate university career the next day you're unemployed and looking for a bad job at starbucks so you know well you see what i mean is you know it's it's that you know one problem that you solve is replaced by another problem and so the idea that you're going to be happy when you solve all your problems is like good luck with that theory but but you know if you're aiming at something worthwhile and you really believe it's worthwhile and you've thought it through you know so that you're not weak you're not weak you've got your damn arguments mustered then when you make progress even a little bit you think hey that's all right and you get a little kick a little dopamine kick and that's what you want because that's where your positive emotion comes from you can use cocaine if you want but but you know that tends to have relatively detrimental medium to long-term consequences but it activates the same system so you have to be aiming at something and you should be aiming at something that's realistic that you want that you could get you know like not easily because if it's easy in some sense you've already got it it's got to push you and that's part of the pleasure actually because there's two things that you want to do when you're pursuing something that's important and one of them is to get the thing that's important but the other is is to make yourself better at pursuing things right so so you can get both of those at the same time you you're aiming at something and you're increasing your competence it's like that's a good deal that's a good deal and there's a lot of intrinsic meaning to be felt in that and then the second half of the program you you write out a plan for for how you're going to do it and how you're going to keep yourself on track and you're going to write about why it would be good for you if you did this and why it would be good for your family and what possible benefits it would have to the community you know because you want to nail this thing down and then you want to figure out what kind of obstacles are going to come up and how you might overcome them and how you might keep yourself on track and all of that and we know because we've actually done a lot of research on this particular program that if university students do this and this is more true if they're not too well oriented to begin with if university students do this they're about 25 less likely to drop out which is a lot and about their grade point average increases about 20 percent so hooray for that you know because you never know when you develop an intervention if it's going to work there's also evidence but not from my lab that doing such things improves your physical health and i think the reason for that is is that you know when you go over your autobiography and you scour out those negative places that you're sort of dragging along with you it lowers your overall stress load because your brain is kind of i think it's calculating how dangerous the world is by attending to the ratio of successes to failures that you've had in your life something like that and so you know if there are holes in your map that you could still fall through then your brain regards the territory still as a bit on the dangerous side and then you more prepared for emergency action and that's hard on you so you want to go back there and fix up those experiences to the degree that you can't
