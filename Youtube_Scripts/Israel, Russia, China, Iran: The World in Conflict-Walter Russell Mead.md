hello everyone I'm touring again in January February actually until the end of May to discuss my last book beyond order there's still tickets available for a couple of venues I thought I might bring those to people's attention today Ottawa Canada January 30th at the Canadian Tire Center Everett Washington USA February 19th at the Angel of the Winds Arena so if you're in those areas or you can travel there and you're interested in hearing me talk about my book trying to extend the ideas in it then please come to Ottawa January 30th or Everett Washington February 19th you can find more information at my website jordanbpeterson.com hope to see you there okay what what what what in the world is the rationale for being soft and Iran I I I don't see a rationale for that at all I mean Iran is a terrible repressive theocracy with nuclear Ambitions it's a dangerous regime so how can you be soft on Iran what is the biggest way you easiest way to get into a war in the Middle East it would be a confrontation with Iran therefore you can't have a confrontation with Iran that's the way I think a lot of people are thinking but I think the logic of the position is we have to say we don't want an Iranian nuclear weapon but actually if you're given a binary choice between a war with Iran with the U.S fighting Iran to keep it from being not nuclear and then or just hoping that if they get a nuclear weapon we can deter them and Israel can deter them like everybody else's with nuclear weapons has been deterred they would say better let them have the bomb than have the War I think that's the the logic of the position and that the Iranians smelling that as the logic of the position have taken a very tough line in negotiations and at this point our con are continuing to press the Biden Administration that's what I think has probably happened [Music] foreign I met Mr Walter Russell Mead at a dinner party in Washington he's a prolific author and a columnist for the Wall Street Journal a very astute commentator on Foreign Affairs I'm talking to him today about well about the situation the international situation in the world as as experienced by the United States and its Western allies let's say we talk about we're going to talk about Russia and China and Iran and Israel and Palestine all the what would you call it predictable villains and uh so Mr Walter Russell Mead is a writer professor in academic focusing his efforts as I said on International policy and Foreign Affairs he is the James Clark Chase professor of Foreign Affairs and Humanities at Bard College and taught U.S foreign policy at Yale Mead has worked as a columnist for Publications such as the Wall Street Journal and was editor at large for the American interest his books include mortal Splendor special Providence power Terror peace and War God and gold and most recently 2022 the Ark of a covenant so Mr Mead you've spent an awful lot of time thinking about foreign policy in in very many different aspects not concentrating necessarily on any particular part of the world but taking as much as it's possible a relatively global view and so maybe we could start our discussion by having you summarize what you think are the most important what are the most important issues that confronted the United States and the Western World more generally on the on the Foreign Relations front in 2022 and maybe we can also talk about what you see happening in in 2023 as we move forward what what's currently besetting Us in the West on the foreign policy front well it's a you know this is a really difficult time the it's important maybe to help people get what's happening in the world is to realize sort of what the basic framework of world politics is and that is that beginning about 300 years ago the British began to build this sort of global commercial order where there's trade there's Commerce and the British also were concerned for creating balance of power in Europe and developing their power globally so that this commercial Maritime system would develop the Americans more or less inherited or some would say took over that system at the end of World War II and this liberal International Maritime commercial system of trade of power of political relationships is the dominant reality in World politics and the world is is more or less divided between countries that are fairly happy with this with this system and would like to see it continue countries who have some grievances would like the system adjusted but are basically willing to work within that system and then countries who want to bring the whole thing down and today the the leading countries that are that are in that are you know China Russia and Iran along with certain smaller Hangers On like Venezuela Cuba Nicaragua and a few others and we've seen since uh you know at the end of the Cold War 1990 it looked as if this anglo-american system would last forever people talked about the end of History but partly because countries like China have developed and become more powerful but maybe more fundamentally because the Americans and our close allies have not done a very good job of understanding how to build and nurture and maintain this system we've seen gradually a kind of a of a crisis of opposition approaching and 2022 between the Russian invasion of Ukraine uh China's continued sort of menacing of Taiwan and Iran's progress refusal to rejoin the jcpoa uh it's it's deepening alliance with Russia we've seen this Alliance of revisionist powers assemble themselves for a real challenge to this International System well so let's maybe we could walk through each of those countries in turn I mean the first uh reaction I have to what you said is that say what you might about the anglo-american sphere of influence it's by no means self-evident that either China Russia or Iran stand out as shining moral lights to emulate as an alternative I mean China is a desperately terrible totalitarian communist state Iran is basically uh islamo fascist regime and while Russia seems to be the outlier to some degree but um you know because at least nominally it could be allied with the west but it certainly uh proved extremely problematic in new ways since the end of the Cold War so I mean on what grounds can countries like China and Iran for example offer anything even remotely like an alternative to the sphere of anglo-american domination let's start with China right well you know China offers what China offers countries or at least did offer because its offering has gotten less attractive uh with between the mounting totalitarianism the economic trouble that they're in and their reaction to covet they were saying look you don't have to buy the Western package in order to become rich and Powerful and furthermore they were saying to somebody like the ruler of a country like Zimbabwe or other countries will give you money will give you Tech we won't ask you any questions about how much money your brother-in-law is making out of the deal no pesky Auditors we will you know we're not like the anglo-americans we won't try to make you behave we'll let you do is it will Empower you to do exactly as you like now that is not a positive agenda for an alternative world order but it is an offer that a lot of governments or a lot of powerful individuals might find attractive yeah powerful and powerful and corrupt individuals I mean it's for okay so let's take that apart a little bit so the first part of that is the proposition that you can actually be wealthy or let's say have abundant resources and a reasonable standard of living living for your citizens not for you without adopting something like the underlying metaphysics of the western moral code and and that proposition strikes me as highly improbable given that the only reason that China is Rich at all is because it managed to integrate itself with the west and essentially adopt quasi-capitalist principles without actually adopting the underlying metaphysic and I don't think their system is stable I don't think they're going to be able to propagate that well-being into the future I mean you said yourself that China has tilted very heavily under ji towards an increasing totalitarianism and that's pretty much self-evident and the fact that they can only peddle their Wares with regards to um what would you say their profitability on the dictator front to corrupt governments also indicates the moral bankruptcy of their offerings so if what if what China has to offer is the ability to bring together you know the corrupt dictators of the world that doesn't seem like a very plausible or sustainable alternative to anglo-american domination right so and and well I mean China seems to be facing a whole host of problems now too including demographic problems that are deadly serious right well you know Jordan this this anglo-american order is 300 years old and a lot of people have tried to shake it over the centuries you know you can go back to Louis XIV in France who said I'm going to have this centralized powerful planned economy we're going to be it we're going to have all the economic and military power of the British but we're not going to have all that messy political liberalism and it didn't work but he put up a good fight that convulsed the world for many years Napoleon really exactly the same challenging that anglo-american still at that time British World Order and saying my dictatorship my enlightened dictatorship can create a powerful economy that the the stupid British cannot match and an army that they can't defeat and he rampaged for quite a while he did ultimately fall apart and rightly so I think Kaiser Wilhelm II I think uh Hitler Tojo and Stalin all in their different ways had the same idea that the sort of technocratic dictatorship centralized power and planning could challenge create an economy in a society that could challenge this anglo-american hegemony this or called the liberal World System and they've they all failed but that you know no they all thought okay I learned from the past now I'll win and I think China is thinking along those lines too yeah well I think I think there's a a fallacy at the bottom of that presumption that basically is biological in nature I mean one of the things I've observed as a consequence of watching the United States as an outsider let's say for 50 years 50 conscious years let's say is that diversity of approach beats efficiency of Monolithic View and so what I always see happening in the United States is while you guys are crazy about 80 percent of the time and going off the rails in five different directions but there's always someone in the United States doing something crazily Innovative insane always and so what seems to happen is that the U.S washes up against the shores of various forms of political idiocy but there's so much diversity of approach in the U.S especially given its massive population and its Federated system and it's and it's genuine freedoms that someone somewhere is doing the next right thing and then America is what would you call it um open-minded enough and adaptive enough so that if someone is doing the right thing then they spawn imitators extremely rapidly and Americans just capitalize on that like mad and you get this situation where you could imagine and I think the Japanese managed this for a while you could imagine that if you just happen to stumble on the right Vision if you were an efficient and benevolent totalitarian you could be more effective over like a five-year period but you're going to have a hell of a time with power transitions that's a deadly problem and then if the world shifts on you that's not in in a way that isn't commensurate with your ideological Vision then you have no alternative approaches to rely on and my observation has been that just scuttles all these countries that try to compete with this distributed and creative free anglo-american ethos and I do think there's a biological reason for that is that you know one of the ways that biological systems compute adaptation is by producing a very large variety of mutations right of variant Offspring and most of those Offspring perish but the only solution to that problem of excess mortality let's say on the biological front is the provision of multiple variants and the anglo-american system because it's distributed and because it places a substantial amount of power in the hands of of individuals and subsidiary organizations it's medium to long-term creativity simply can't be beat and it is inefficient in that it's you know a lot of the variants that the U.S produces a lot of businesses and so forth fail but those that succeed can succeed spectacularly and that happens continually and that seems like an Unstoppable force and you know you just outlined 300 years of History showing that these monolithic centralists who believe that Central planning and efficiency will defeat distributed creativity they just they're just wrong one after the other you'd think eventually we learned that that was just wrong and maybe we have to some degree yeah well I think the the circle is spreading of countries or cultures and individuals who do see this Advantage but as again as a student of History rather than biology or or psychology what I see is that we keep having these wars and so you know I can say I actually do believe the Chinese system the Russian system in its own way the Iranian system certainly cannot really continue as as they wish and will fail in the competition I look at the devastation that we've seen the Napoleonic Wars the world wars and so our problem on our side is not simply to wait for the time when our diversity and our Innovation will will clearly Triumph but we have to try to manage or work in foreign policy and and security policy to to try to prevent new sort of new catastrophic War hours on the scale even though the chances are pretty good that we will prevail in the end right right right well it looks to me right now on the Chinese front I mean they're they're experiencing a level of domestic unrest that for China appears to be somewhat unprecedented and it seems to me that it's perhaps clearly in the interest of the Chinese authorities to do something like saber rattle extremely hard over Taiwan to divert their populace's attention from their domestic failures and so that strikes me as a I mean maybe I'm being pessimistic about it although obviously lots of people are concerned about China and Taiwan I mean G seems to be attempting to consolidate power in the same manner as people like Mao he's turned out to be a real a real totalitarian dictator rather than someone who's you know moving China or maybe like doubt like uh um the the Chinese leader who modernized uh does it tell what's his name um yes exactly he doesn't seem like another dungsho ping he seems to be more like another Mao and that that's very worrisome on the Taiwan front so what do you what do you think's in the on the horizon on the China front and what do you think the West should do about it right no it's it's it's really interesting because from the Chinese point of view first of all we have to understand that the people that people like I and and you would talk to from China are not aren't representative of the mass of the Chinese in China the average China Chinese person has never left China didn't study for years in a in the English-speaking world of an American or Canadian University or what have you um you know and for them it it looks very frustrating they see China as this great nation with a growing economy largest population in the world at least until India catches up and then they look and they see look at Iran a tiny country backwards in many ways compared to China which has been running the table in the Middle East you know it's in Syria it's in Lebanon it's in Yemen it's causing problems everywhere you look even Russia has gotten Crimea and has achieved things where has the Chinese government gotten you know what is it done the answer is it's done less than Iran done less than China sorry than Russia in terms of expanding so I think the there's pressure on the Chinese government from a lot of Chinese public opinion why aren't you more effective if we're as great as you're telling us why don't the foreigners see that and give ground to us so there's a clash between what a lot of Chinese people think China's place in the world should be and what they actually see and the government as you say at this time of huge stress the coveted policy they locked them down for years and now they're still having a massive epidemic they um the the housing market which is where most Chinese have their savings and investment house prices have been going down for almost three years there's a major crisis building financially in China and so the government is in a real pickle as to what does it do next and that makes it obviously that makes it a little bit unpredictable internationally well so well I was just curious as to your evaluation of the Biden administration's response to the situation in Taiwan do you what opinions do you have about the Biden formulation of China of foreign policy in relationship to China look I think um the Biden Administration has done a reasonably good job so far in terms of its messaging on Taiwan and on the U.S China relations the chip act and it's you know it's putting economic pressure it it is trying to stop the penetration you know so much of Chinese growth has really come from the theft of Ip and from intellectual property from uh Chinese State subsidies to corporations you know in key sectors that are able to use those subsidies to compete unfairly in the rest of the world and that we are beginning to see and this you know it started in the Trump years and even President Obama talked about a pivot to Asia so there's been a growing awareness in the U.S on a need to focus more on China and not just sort of sit here and wait for capitalism to turn China democratic which is what we were maybe doing 20 years ago so we're definitely ahead on that front [Music] with the start of the New Year upon us what better time than now to

what's happened in China well first of all when I started to become politically aware let's say back in the 1970s I remember going to a Trade Fair in Edmonton Alberta it was one of the first trade fairs that the Chinese participated in not probably about 1974 something like that and we went and looked at uh the Chinese had a display there of their Industrial Products and it looked like stuff that had been manufactured in the west right after the second world war like it looked like stuff that was built in the 1950s but that was the first time in my lifetime that we saw anything at all of China and then of course when I was very young uh the threat of famine was still something that we associated with China and what I've seen happen in my lifetime is that China has become an economic Powerhouse that the threat of famine has receded substantially that the Chinese had been integrated at least to some degree into the world economy that the West had benefited arguably from an influx of unbelievably inexpensive consumer goods as Chinese manufacturing quality improved as it did in Japan and for a good while it looked like the Chinese were going to settle in beside us in lockstep even though as competitors and Cooperators and move us all towards a relatively integrated capitalist future and of course the presumption was that as that happened that the state would liberalize not least because there'd be all sorts of individuals in China who now had a certain degree of economic power and you know that the Chinese would incrementally transform into essentially into allies playing under the same system and I think that really was happening in a pretty damn optimistic way for a number of decades till she decided to centralize control and turn himself into another Mao and it isn't obvious that the optimism that the West had in relationship to China was exactly misplaced I mean I think the Western working Clause paid a big price for integrating China but other than that you know the Chinese aren't starving anymore which is certainly a big plus and like there were a lot of positives to attempting to integrate the Chinese into the world economy the downside was we seem to become more dependent on their largesse and Goodwill than we needed to and then of course China as a totalitarian model is a destabilizing force in the international order well you're absolutely right and I I would agree with you completely that well look you know until a few years ago I would travel pretty freely in China and a couple of my books have been translated into Chinese and I would speak at Chinese universities and talk with professors and and officials and the view that you just expressed is was very common this is what they felt China was doing and should do was move toward this kind of integration to become what some Chinese used to tell me a normal country is what they wanted China to become and I think there are a lot of people there who still hope that obviously they're they're not going to say so right now that would that would not be good for you or your family if you started talking that way but there I think the what happened in some ways is we've we tended to forget that the Chinese Communist party is a real thing and it wants to hold right power you know and there are lots of people who see you know they look at Chinese history yes the Communist party has killed more Chinese than anything ever in the history of the world have died as a result of Mao's famines and other things far eclipsing the death toll say in their war against Japan even but that said as you've pointed out the the economic growth of the last 30 35 years in China is one of the great miracles of human history yeah and you would you would have to have a Heart of Stone not to be glad that hundreds of millions of people have come out of poverty that a new new ways of life are opening up new access to culture to education it's it's what life what we should all be doing it's it's progress and it's good right but that very progress of the society I think terrified the Communist Party because they could see themselves losing control they could see you know and and there is in Chinese history and culture you know it's a it's a country of a billion four people that's like what four times the population of the European Union and it's not so easy to Chinese history is a story of the balance between central and local governments they've had periods of division and War and weakness when others have taken advantage when the central government was weak so instead of in a way relaxing and liberalizing more as their Economic Policy succeeded many in the Chinese Communist Party became you know really worried that things were things were going to get out of control and for a number of years even before we saw the um you know the international hostility what we saw was gradually in sector after sector they were tightening up the control of this Central communist Elite and more and more under one man Xi Jinping they were tightening every using every lever they could to impose uniform uniformity in China to reassert even in companies now every company has to have a Communist Party sell in it so the part we're we're back to the kind of Communist Party Thomas Stars yes exactly and obviously as a western investor that's a tough thing when you've got the Communist Party cell running your company you do you really own the company Etc so it's a yeah right right so so they're they're moving I think from a good period into a much more difficult one I think right well I think also that people were optimistic and rightly so after 1989 because once the Soviets gave up the ghost it looked for a pretty long period of time that you couldn't beat the Communist drum very hard anymore that the internal contradictions that were part and parcel of the ethos had made themselves manifest in a manner that was utterly unmistakable and just as the Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its own internal idiocy so was the Chinese Communist Party doomed to eventual failure and it's certainly and now but I guess part of the problem is that even in the west you know we don't seem to be of one mind when we look at the contradiction between Western productivity and generosity let's say and general well-being at the level of the citizen and the contradictions between that and a radical leftist view of the world right I mean our own our own Society is Rife with this culture War predicated at least on the part that capitalism is inherently oppressive and well and so is Western culture in general and of course the Chinese Communists believe that in Spades and if we can't get our own house in order with regards to the Pathology of these ideas in the West in some sense it's not that surprising that the Chinese remain dominated by them but but the long-term consequences of that can't be good I mean what I see happening I think in in the West in the U.S in particular is that people are losing faith in China as a trading partner and we're starting to pull back a tremendous amount of manufacturing capacity and decreasing investment and pulling away from China as a trading partner and of course that'll just make things more desperate in China which is not a good thing yeah it's it's a tricky thing we in the west we read 1989 and the events in the Soviet Union as a you know a glorious Victory but in China and and Putin is is on their wavelength here they saw it very differently what they saw is it look at the Soviet Union Gorbachev tried to to liberalize and to introduce some democratic elements into the Soviet Union and look what happened the Soviet Union fell apart Russia was impoverished for a decade it lost its great power status in the world and you know and the West as they saw it in Russia and in China just you know sort of walked all over them and did whatever it wanted and so and the Iranians saw this too so the message for these leaders is don't liberalize liberalism is a poison and even a little bit of it can begin to corrode and destroy your society and if you let it in it will wreck your power and devastate everything so there they actually became they they did not say oh how enchanting Western democracy is they said how dangerous it is and we've heard Putin complain and talk about the color revolutions different liberalizing Revolutions in post-soviet countries and they see us they see the West as leading this kind of subversion and that Western ideas and Western freedoms are a fundamental threat to their own power and given the uses some of them have made of that power made to their personal survival right right well though that seems like a reasonable concern for totalitarian for ideologically Motivated totalitarian dictators it's definitely the case that Western liberal ideals will not provide an environment where they're kind of Psychopathic power playing is going to be successful right they have every reason to be intimidated by that right and I think our mistake was not to realize that you know we were saying hey we're not you know we're going to wait patiently for China to evolve but on the side of the Chinese Communist party they were saying well we're not just going to wait patiently until liberalism comes in and wrecks us we're going to preemptively do what we need to do to maintain our power so I think well maybe we should have known that because they never wavered in their support for North Korea that's right and they were also very careful always to say we want economic liberalization not political liberalization yeah yeah as if those that well okay so let's concentrate on that a little bit so it's it's not obvious to me at all that you get to have economic liberalization without political liberalization in fact I think the order of of of events in that in that causal link is reversed is that the reason that we have abundance and material prosperity in the west is because of liberalism liberalism isn't the consequence of wealth it's the precondition for wealth and if you can think about that particularly with regards to such things as the right to private property and the right to the fruits of your own labor if your Society isn't predicated on the idea that the individual is somehow intrinsically worthwhile and Sovereign in that manner that's not merely a gift of the state but something intrinsic to the person as soon as you have that you have at least in principle an inviolable right to something approximating private property unto the fruits of your own labor and without that fundamental presumption which I think most particularly is a judeo-christian Biblical presumption the whole capitalist Enterprise and it's because it's so reliant on trust and honesty as well for example to really flourish and on the right of private property it's just a non-starter and so this is a this is a favorite shibboleth of the West is that well we can have all this economic Prosperity or even more of it with a centralized top-down control system that's predicated on the idea of equality but in reality that never seems to pan out and so and I don't I mean you could point to regimes maybe like Singapore as a potential exception but Singapore isn't very old and so we'll see how it does with regards to such things as power transitions but the idea that you can have economic progress without that underlying ethos of individual sovereignty I don't think there's any historical evidence for that at all and and there's plenty of evidence to the contrary you describe that in terms of the constant failure of the dictator States you know it's interesting uh is that I mean I I think you're right and that the you know sort of human nature exists in such a way that this kind of that private property and those the culture of individual rights together is honesty is a is foundation for greater Prosperity but the foundations of of different cultures around the world have a very different relationship to that set of ideas and you know I remember the first time I started traveling in Russia it was still the Soviet Union uh one of the I'm I'm giving away how old I am I suppose but one of the things I noticed there was that Marxism was was culturally attractive to a lot of people in Russia because there was a deep distrust of economic exchange that the people kind of intuitively felt that if you at least this is the way it seemed to me that if a if a merchant went into the countryside and bought a bushel of wheat for five rubles from the farmer and then took it into town and sold it for 10 rubles to the consumers in the in the town he was cheating somebody you know maybe he was treating the farmer maybe he was cheating his customers but that this kind of exchange was fundamentally morally illegitimate and so there was so Marxism felt felt right in us you know that that capitalism was by Nature exploitative a lot of people were induced to believe that yeah well that it's easy it's easy for that belief to be induced because it can capitalize on envy and envy is a deadly sin let's say um and it's easy to become envious of anyone who seems to have something that you don't have especially if you don't like look at the other person's life in totality you see one feature in their life that in some manner exceeds what you've been able to manage and then it's it's also extremely convenient for you to assume that if someone has exceeded you in a particular dimension of attainment that the reason they did that is because they're corrupt and malevolent not because they're useful and productive compared to you and so one of the psychological advantages that envious Marxism has is that it it plays to Envy in a an extremely powerful awful Manner and the problem with that seems to be and maybe this is another principle for economic advancement if your Society is predicated on the idea that all difference in attainment or socioeconomic status is a consequence of theft and exploitation then basically you set up a situation where no one can ever have anything more than anyone else in which case you have no basis for trade whatsoever and you certainly can't generate anything approximating wealth because there's just no way that everyone can become equally Rich at the same instantaneous moment there's always going to be a gradation of distribution and one of the weird things the West has managed and this has something to do with that implicit trust is that we've actually managed to develop a society where there's not only tolerance for inequality but there's a certain degree of admiration for it right I mean and I think this is particularly true of the US where it's less true of Canada and Europe but one of the things that's always struck me so positively about the U.S is that there is a general sense of admiration among the populace for people who've been able to achieve spectacularly and singularly in some domain and some of that's associated with the desire in the U.S that parents have for their children to be able to perhaps accomplish the same thing but it really is quite the miracle that any society has ever managed out at all you know it's interesting in some Dimensions even in the Soviet Union you could see that because if you went to a concert in the Soviet Union no classical music was a big thing the admiration that people felt for a great violinist or a great dancer was extraordinary because in every other channel of life he was utterly corrupted by the party if you had a good job it was because the Communist Party gave it to you if you you know if if you were a factory director it was because your brother-in-law was the party commissar something like that but in the Arts you know that violinist is just up there playing it you hear it and that gives you um you know so there was this direct contact with Excellence so the human spirit I think does instinctively respond to you know Excellence with admiration they weren't thinking let's go break his fingers you know he plays better than the others so he should like lose a finger and then he won't play any better than anybody else but in this in the realm of Economics no they you know they had a very different View foreign footballs or

what's driving uh react the reactionary Chinese and that's a reversion to the communist model and to the totalitarian state that it enables and that's being driven by the people who are benefiting from that enabling that seems relatively clear the Russian front is a lot more complicated because it's not obvious at all that Putin is a communist for example and I know that Dugan who is who's Putin's favorite philosopher has been trying to sketch out something approximating a different ethos for the Russians and I know that some of that actually has its Origins both in Dostoevsky and solzhenitzen who both proclaimed in various ways that the proper way forward for Russia was a return to something like its incremental progression along the Orthodox Christian path and I I think the Russians are struggling with that to some degree and Dugan has tried to outline an alternative ethos but I don't see anything coherent coming out of that except antipathy to the progressive liberal excesses of the West I don't see that the Russians have actually managed to elaborate anything approximately creating a vision and so what do you think's driving the Russians yeah I think you know it's um there is a tragic sense of of History um you know you Russian history has been a a bitter thing Putin is not a communist he is uh he's if anything he's a czarist he's a he's a Russian Nationalist and you know he actually hates the Communists because Lenin and uh you know Lennon's nationality policy really destroyed the Russian Empire in some ways by creating this artificial Soviet Union rather than the the Empire the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine under Khrushchev was the kind of you know communist BS that Putin really loved what but there is something Putin deeply envies and old misses in in Russia today which is that the Communist Party had an for most of its history had an ideological hold in Russia it had a network of loyal informants and co-workers and members so there would be somebody on every block watching what everyone else did and Reporting the bad guys to the suspicious activity to the secret police and through the network of Communist Party cells youth organizations this whole culture the government had measure means to control shape public opinion Putin doesn't have that okay that he he's trying with Russian nationalism with the Orthodox Church he's trying to find and of course in places where um most of the Russian citizens are Muslim he tries to work through Islamic religious authorities remember that the Orthodox church and the Muslim hierarchies were entirely controlled by the KGB under the Communists so when the Soviet Union collapsed all the KGB hacks and Stooges were in place now of course there were some sincere Believers here and there but you know but and so the and so there was black male material ways that you could control the Orthodox Church ways you control and Putin has tried to turn that into an instrument of State Control now you know that's not that's not as illegitimate in some ways in Russian culture as it might seem to some of us because the Orthodox Church in its theology was always much more supportive of the Tsar the the emperor it you know it comes out of the Byzantine tradition where uh so there's a kind of some people use the phrase Cesaro papism you know the the Caesar the emperor is a holy figure as well so it you know they've got a they've it it comports in some ways with the tradition with traditional Russian ideas but Russian Society changed a lot in the last hundred years you know the Russia was a peasant Society in 1920 and today it's mostly an urban Society Etc it's in many many different ways it's changed and so Putin does not have the ideological elements of control the other problem for Putin is that Russian Orthodoxy and Russian nationalism don't export the way Marxism leninism did at the height of Communism Stalin could count on the fanatical loyalty of even highly placed spies like algerhis in America and Kim philby in England who out of loyalty to Communism would be willing agents and Stooges for Stalin Putin doesn't have that he's hoping with his opposition to you know some of the crazy things that are definitely going on here he and Orban and some others are sort of trying to kind of create a sort of conservative traditionalist International that can do for them what the international Communists used to do for Stalin but it doesn't it's it's it's not going to work that way it's a much weaker position but Putin is doing what he can with the tools he can find to make Russia a great power you know I think partly it's weaker because if you try to Ally Christian theology with the idea of a centralized quasi-fascist state it actually doesn't work out very well because there's such a strong emphasis on individual sovereignty and individual worth in the judeo-christian tradition that you're you're fighting a pretty vicious rear guard action I mean it was definitely the case that when the Bible was printed and distributed so that everyone could read it in the original that what happened was people recognized their own intrinsic worth and we're much more likely to what would you say take on both the the right right and the responsibilities of informed citizenry as soon as they became literate and could understand the implications of that tradition and so it isn't obvious to me at all that Putin is going to be able to manage to Shanghai the Christian tradition into alliance with the idea that he should be something approximating a czar even if the progressive West has you know aired in its excesses which it which it certainly has the story just doesn't seem to have a lot of power I mean it's definitely the case the Eastern Europeans are quite appalled by the Western turn towards this radical progressivism but that hasn't driven them into the arms of people like Putin no exactly this is a very you know again there was a very Russian tradition of the Tsar as almost the leader of the church as well as the leader of the state but it doesn't and and the concept of rights as we understand them to be implanted in the judeo-christian tradition was much more minimized in the in the old Russian Orthodox Vision it was a much more collectivist kind of faith and so the and and the gap between Orthodox Europe and both Protestant and Catholic Europe is a very deep historical when it's over a thousand years old but um so Putin put something that works in Russia at least for a time is is not exportable in the way Putin would like it to be now he has another option which he works with which is this free-floating you know so Putin will try on the one hand to be the champion of the uh you know the people who are in revolt against the progressive excesses of the west but at the same time he wants to pick up the other source of Soviet support anti-capitalism anti-western individualism you know the far left and as those are the two things that Putin is working with and in U.S politics it's interesting that you get people you know the the uh the squad tends to be very skeptical of U.S policy in Ukraine as do people on the very far right now there are a lot of legitimate questions you can ask about what we are and aren't doing in Ukraine but this kind of sympathy quasi-putinous sympathy you will find it among anti-americans on the left as well as among sort of some traditionalists on the right and that's that's Putin Putin doesn't care you know for him he'll use he'll use any tool he can find and that's that's how he sees these people not as allies and partners but as tools to be used to achieve his end which is first last and always Russian state power what do you think his goal was in the Ukraine when I when I looked at what was happening I thought two things I thought well three things I suppose Putin wasn't very happy with Western expansionism into Ukraine um he also was more than willing to extend Russian Dominion especially in the Eastern parts of Ukraine and then I also thought it's possible that he didn't really care in some fundamental sense whether Ukraine emerged from this conflict devastated as long as it didn't fall into the hands of the west but I'm still relatively unclear about what his motivations and vision were for The Invasion I mean do you think he thought it would be a cakewalk like so many military leaders tend to presume when they when they March into a foreign country or what was up what was Putin exactly imagining U.S intelligence also thought he was going to win you know the Americans were saying to zielinski will give you a plane so you can escape and we were telling the ambassadors of all the countries leave leave the Russians are coming there was a panic all right so our message to Putin by the way was not a message of deterrence it was a message of encouragement we think our intelligence is terrific and it tells us you're going to win if you do this so you know that's that's interesting I think he did think he would he would get a lot of success very quickly but as to the threat of Ukraine to Putin it's not like Western it's not that like there might be Western troops in Kiev it's clear we don't want to invade Russia no one in the west wants to invade Russia no one there's no support in the United States for sending an army into Russia right that is that's not on the table but what is on the table is suppose Ukraine democratizes and becomes a successful country Putin's whole argument to the Russian people is that oh you know democracy may work fine for the English and the French and the Americans but we Russians we're different we Orthodox Slavs we have our own tradition in our own world Kiev really is where Russian Civil the birthplace of Russian civilization Ukraine for Russians is part of their Heartland and if Ukrainian Slavs Orthodox Ukrainian Slavs are happy and prosperous in a democracy and achieving things that are corrupt stagnant sterile putinous regime is unable to achieve in Russia a happy Democratic Ukraine without lifting a finger without sending a single shot across the frontier is a mortal threat to Putin's power and vision at home that's the problem okay so does that make does that make a devastated Ukraine and a Russian withdrawal a Putin Victory I think yet Putin wants Ukraine to fail he want and he wants to be seen to be dominant in Ukraine those are the two things he needs and and the minimal minimal grounds for victory for him yeah and Crimea okay so so okay so now what do you see we don't know how the Russia Ukraine war is going to continue I mean the Russians have been being pushed back but they're unbelievably heavily armed in the final analysis and it isn't obvious exactly what a Ukrainian Victory would look like in the face of that ultimately overwhelming let's say nuclear threat and so it I've I've heard red let's say uh intimations that potent might be willing to sit at the bargaining table now what what do you think are we in for a long War are we in for a long deteriorating War that's moving to a nuclear exchange is Putin feeling pressure to get to the negotiating table um what what's your sense of where things how things are going to unfold over the next year well I think we're uh we're in back the war has gone through several phases already and it's important to to remember it's been so long since we were all thinking about a big war in this way we've all forgotten some of the things that are normal in Warfare and one of them is that war changes so like in World War II you start with 10 months of zits Creek no one is doing anything then Hitler conquers everything and oh my gosh he's going to win but then another stalemate Etc it changes and in this war there was the initial phase of Russian attacks and people for a while thought those might succeed then the Ukrainian defeat then we went into that long period of like slow grinding Russian advances then there were the heartening Ukrainian pushback and everybody said ah their whole Russian army could disintegrate Etc they seem at least for now to have stabilized their front we don't really know and with the missile attacks and Russia you know fighting on the boundaries are we back to grinding War of Attrition or because you know the morale in the Russian army is quite low in some places you know could we see more military collapses like we saw you know on the Russian side Etc so there's a lot going on both the ukrainians and the Russians still think they have some cards to play and neither one is willing to give up until they they don't think they could gain something extra by trying something else so both now you know the West is saying to zielinski come on at least look like you want to talk piece so he says you know I'm ready to sit down you know and discuss peace on the following terms basically complete Russian withdrawal and reparations and Putin also feeling some internal pressure to and from some others to sound at least look like he's interested in pieces yes I'm interested I want peace talks on the surrender of Ukraine to me and on exactly what pieces of Ukraine I'll take but neither side at this point is is ready to stop fighting so I I don't see immediately much change and and both and and the future will be determined by how the armies do on the ground the god of battles will determine where we are and then in the you know as the reality changes the two sides appreciation of what they can reasonably hope to achieve change and at some point maybe there will be we'll see you know a negotiated peace right but you think there's a fair bit of War to come before that right there because it isn't obvious that either side is losing in some fundamental sense right it's still very ambivalent each side has reasons to believe that it can gain from where it is now and as long as that's the case uh the tendency is for the war to continue yes okay okay let's turn our attention momentarily to the situation in Iran I'd like to talk about two uh different streams there the first would be the protests and then also we could talk about Iran in relationship to Israel and also the Iranians nuclear program when I was in Jerusalem I met with some senior people um who'd worked in various ways for the Israeli government over the years and some of them were very concerned about Iran's capacity to move very rapidly towards the development of a nuclear bomb and my understanding is that they're still experimenting quite heavily with sophisticated centrifuges that are designed to push them to the point where developing a nuclear weapon could take place if necessary within a few months and and so and it's it it seems to me to be the case that Iran is Israel's most fundamental enemy and is devoted in some real sense to the eradication of Israel and and so that's all extremely uh worrisome in some sense um counterbalanced against that is the fact that the Iranians themselves seem to be pretty damn sick and tired of their state and God only knows what's going to happen as a consequence of the protests and I mean we could get lucky possibly and see the Iranian regime collapse although a collapsed regime is often replaced by a worse regime unfortunately rather than a better one so anyways tell me your views about Iran uh in relationship to the U.S in relationship to Israel in relationship to the ongoing protests what's happening there as far as you can tell and what do you see happening in the future well in the first place I think that hostility to the United States and Israel and more broadly to the West is baked into the nature of the current Iranian regime you know since they they need a bad relationship with the United States they need a bad relationship with Israel how why else do you justify a clerical dictatorship if you don't have terrible enemies out there who are going to destroy you and they also remember that that Iran is a multi-ethnic multi-linguistic multicultural country it has a large azeri minority in the north it has a lot of Kurds and the Kurds in Iran are restless like Kurds in other countries they want independence for Kurds you've got Beluga style you've got the blocks in the in the South you have a large group of Arabs in Iran and most of the oil in Iran or a lot of it is in the is in the part that's inhabited by Arabs and the the central government wants to keep pumping the oil but spending the revenue not on the Arab provinces where it's come from but to maintain its power regionally so Iran is is filled with these ethnic tensions and you need something to hold a country like that together and Iran for example looks at what happens when the Soviet Union when the Soviet Union lost its faith in communism so to speak the the cement that held it together the Soviet Union fell apart so the fear in there's a tremendous fear in the government of Iran that without an ideology that legitimizes and empowers Central Authority who knows what could happen and especially with other countries whether it's turkey Russia the United States anybody trying to pull away at its territories so that's one reason they're not I think this whole fantasy that we can reach an agreement with the Iranians and everything could be nice was never very likely but more than that because they need an enemy well I also think it's been very convenient for the Iranians to have Israel as an enemy as well and to funnel support to the Palestinians and keep that conflict boiling away madly because as you said there's nothing that helps legitimize an authoritarian State then the presence of obvious malevolent enemies so you know one of the preconditions for peace agreements obvious is that both sides actually want peace and that doesn't seem to me at all obvious as you pointed out in the case of Iran quite the contrary exactly and and when it comes to Israel they've got something else going you know Iran entertains the fan we've talked about Iran's fears what are its hopes the hopes are if a single country could control the Persian Gulf and all the oil there even in this time of oil in other places and alternative energy that's huge power globally you can sort of blackmail the world and the Iranians look at the these small Arab Gulf States many you know 90 percent of the population and some is foreign workers uh Bahrain has uh you know is a country ruled by Sunni Muslims but has a lot you know has a large Shia majority there's a rest of Shia minority in Saudi Arabia so Iran really sees opportunities and look at what it's been able to do thanks I think to American stupidity in Syria but also in Lebanon Iran is really moving has been moving across the Middle East it's in Yemen so um but here's the thing arrests Shia Islam is not popular among Sunni Muslims it's uh it's considered a heresy and and the Persians are are not really you know the Arab Persian problem is real so for to be the most anti-israel is a way of advertising your credentials I'm I hate we're such good Muslims that we hate Israel and unlike all these nasty Gulf rulers are willing to compromise and all this we're in this to the death if you hate Israel you know right you love Islam we're Your Leader they are not gonna give that up they are not going to give that up and if the other Arabs are walking away from violence among the Palestinians well the the Iranians would be more than happy to fill that Gap so this is right you know this idea that somehow they're these moderates and you know they're just ready to make a deal I'm sure there are moderates in Iran but the hard core of the power structure I think sees the logic both in terms of the fears and the hopes and they don't see an advantage in changing we'll be back in one moment first we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new documentary logos and literacy I was very much struck by how the translation of the biblical writings jump started the development of literacy across the entire world illiteracy was the norm the pastor's home was the first school and every morning it would begin with singing the Christian faith is a singing religion probably 80 percent of Scripps memorization today exists only because of what is sung this is amazing here we have a Gutenberg Bible printed on the Press of Johann gooper science and religion are opposing forces in the world but historically that has not been the case now the book is available to everyone from Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to to civilization itself it is the most influential book in all of history and hopefully people can walk away with at least a sense of that so let's discuss a little bit um one of the things that struck me I was reading your book uh the the latest book Arc of a covenant published in 2022 and it's an analysis at least in large part of the situation in relationship to Israel and the Zionist State and Palestine and I thought that your book was remarkably even-handed I've been fascinated by the developments on the Abraham Accord front I've interviewed a number of people who are associated with abrahamic Accords and from what I've been able to understand what essentially happened was that a group of people who were Outsiders in relationship to the foreign policy establishment decided to Buck conventional wisdom which was that there was no possibility for peace between the Israelites the Israelis and the Arab world without including the Palestinians just to do an end run around that and to start to talk to Arab countries who are actually interested in well keeping Iran under control but also in making peace with the Israel Israelis for strategic reasons partly because they're a major military power but also for economic reasons because so many Arab states are now looking to differentiate their economies away from Reliance on the petrodollar and so what seemed to have happened with the Abraham Accords was a very large group of Arab countries decided that peace with Israel was definitely in their best interests and that did circumvent the Palestinians now I've been pretty uh sympathetic let's say to the operations of the Israelis in in the Middle East and I've been criticized to a large degree for failing to take into account the oppression of the Palestinians and your work seems to be remarkably even-handed in that regard and you commented just before we started this interview that you wrote a book on a very contentious topic and so that would be the israel-palestinian situation but you didn't really contribute to an exacerbation of the culture war and you really didn't get pillared for it and so what that seems to indicate is is that you struck kind of a nice balance between advocating on the Jewish side in relationship to Israel and also pointing out that by no means a majority of Jews around the world even support the Zionist project and also extending a certain degree of Sympathy for the displaced Palestinians so maybe you could could you walk us through your view of the Abraham Accord and your view of the situation in Israel vis-a-vis the Palestinians sure sure let me start with the with the root the the israeli-palestinian situation um you know it's uh Americans were actually you know pro-israel before the Jews were um non-jewish Americans in in uh in the 1890s before teodor herzl the founder of modern Zionism had written his book on the Jewish State uh president United States got a petition asking him to use his influence to promote a Jewish state in Palestine and this petition was signed by John D Rockefeller J.P Morgan and the entire sort of American establishment was on board with this idea um and I myself you know thousands of years of persecution the horrors of the 20th century uh if any people on Earth need a state and and for that matter deserve a state surely it's the juice at the same time you know the Palestinians are a people they they became a people in part because of the struggle with Israel and with the zionists um and and they're human beings and and human beings have rights and as an American I I believe in rights and rights like self-determination so my hope is still although it's difficult and complicated that there would be you know that someday I'd be able to travel from the Jewish State freely to the Palestinian State and have friends in both places that's what I would like to see now in the book I don't make recommendations I you know I think right now it's very hard to get there but that's what I think most Americans would like to see and is what I would like to see okay so you cite Mark Twain in your book and let me just see if I can find that here um yes here's a citation from Mark Twain now see I when I talked to Netanyahu one of the claims that was put forward on his part was that before the Zionist movement the Palestinian territory that now now Israel was pretty damn desolate and Abandoned and um the Palestinian observers of that conversation are very upset about that characterization um feeling that it's in the best interests of the zionists to portray pre-jewish Palestine as a desolate and abandoned Wasteland now but you cite um let me read this yet to americanize the land that the Bible famously described as flowing with milk and honey appeared bone dry and deserted in the 19th century and it's handful of it inhabitants Arabs and Jews seemed deeply wretched and pray to disease in poverty Mark Twain in one of his popular travel columns wrote from Abraham's time till now Palestine has been peopled only with ignorant degraded lazy unwashed loafers and Savages for Twain and for many Americans the holy land was wasted on its current inhabitants whose poor stewardship had turned the land of King Solomon and King David into as Twain quipped the most hopeless dreary heartbroken piece of territory outside of Arizona now it's certainly the case that one of the claims to Israeli legitimacy in my understanding is the idea that this was a particularly God forsaken piece of territory the Ottomans themselves weren't that interested in holding on to it it hadn't been utilized particularly effectively and one of the consequences of this highness Enterprise is that was once was essentially Barren desert Wasteland has been turned into an extremely populous and productive and economically thriving and blooming country and I have some sympathy for that viewpoint but then that leaves that brings into clear uh Focus the the problematic elements of that story in relationship to the Palestinians and so if you were going to make a case for the Palestinians vis-a-vis the Israelis if you would how would you characterize that in light of these sorts of descriptions of pre-zionist Palestine well I don't want to pit them against each other but I would say that that my Palestinian friends would say and I would have some sympathy with this perspective that you have to remember that that you know the Palestinians weren't self-governing in the 19th century they were part they'd been for 500 years or 400 years of that part of the Ottoman Empire and so they were ruled from Istanbul by and Turks who you know saw the Arabs more as a cow to be milked than as so they were they were victims of Ottoman imperialism then before the British came and you know that I think would be the kind of argument that people would make I would go a little deeper and say a lot of the um you know the Redevelopment and the blooming of Palestine has come about because of modern techniques of agronomy and irrigation which no one knew in the 19th century in a sense and you know the Israelis have really brought I mean people all over the world are using their dry farming techniques and their irrigation techniques and some of their desalinization and other stuff so they really have brought something but to compare a 21st century Israel to a 19th century Palestine you know it's it's it's a little tricky as a historical comparison I think right right right right so yeah right so you have multiple problems with that kind of comparison yeah um the advancement of Technology being one of them so how many people how many people are we talking about inhabiting the place that is now Israel in the in the say in the late 19th in the late 19th century again do you know it's the the estimates vary wildly because of course again the Ottoman Empire was not a place where you had careful statistics so you don't have every 10 years the decennial census with an organized modern Bureau bureaucracy counting the numbers so you know what do you how do you estimate that population you know what's what is your basis for it and when you have such a politically contentious question as Israel Palestine where everybody's got a point of view everybody's got an agenda without even cheating you can find all kinds of ways to get to different population estimates for 1890. if you see what I mean so yeah I I honestly don't think and you know in all of these one of the things I in Ark of the Covenant the book I try to make clear is that in many ways this dispute between the Israelis and the Palestinians is one of a hundred such disputes you know croats and serbs in the former Yugoslavia hungarians versus Romanians in Transylvania they're all these National disputes and in all of them what you find is these Scholars and historians and ideologues they make all kind kinds of claims based on history I I wrote I was in Romania and somebody said yeah the magyars they have no place in here they're Interlopers they only got here in the 9th Century A.D which right right to an American that's not very convincing argument but um but anyway everybody comes armed with these battalions of facts that they just throw each at each other we're not going to get the solution by sifting ultimately through those facts you know that is raking over if you have a husband and a wife who've quarreled raking over every quarrel in the marriage is not actually the way to get them moving forward no no no right you need you need something like a uniting vision no I I think that's that's a very good point and I mean part of the reason that there is conflict everywhere when there is conflict is because the facts themselves are open to question I mean that's almost like the definition of the precondition for a war we don't agree what the realities are on the ground at all and we disagree with them so vociferously that we can't even discuss them we have to Now kill each other and we disagree with with the rules you know like what what should adjudicate something is it you know so so the zionists will say and and their right to say so the League of Nations recognize the British mandate over Palestine as a national home for the Jews so it's legal the U.N reaffirmed it in 1948 how much more legal at 47 how much more legal could that be and a Palestinian might say well you know the British were colonial Interlopers who stole the land from the Ottoman Empire or you know and the Palestinians never had a voice what gave the League of Nations the right to say that the British had a right to the territory that's Imperial right right right you and and and they're both arguments um and and people will have different reasons for supporting them well and then there's India there's logical reasons two things that that very masterfully at in this book The Ark of the Covenant the first is I would say you make this remarkable case which you touched on earlier that a tremendous amount of impetus for the Zionist movement wasn't specifically Jewish it happened to dovetail with a stream of Christian evangelism that's probably the right way to think about it that viewed the emergence of a Jewish state in the Middle East as part of the Fulfillment of biblical prophetic tradition and you point out as you did with the Rockefellers for example and with JP Morgan that there were Zionist movements on the Christian front that at least developed in parallel with the Zionist movement on the Jewish front and in many places preceded it and so one of the things I found quite compelling about your book was the detailing out of the remarkable and strange support that the Zionist project found in the Christian West and so you also point out that if it was up to the Jews worldwide and they had out a democratic vote let's say with regards to Israeli policies it's by no means obvious that the Hawks on the Israeli side would be the most popular uh let's say put forward the most popular Viewpoint in relationship to what Jews themselves believe and that there's there's no evidence at all that what do you call it the Vulcan Planet Theory it's something like that that the whole Zionist project is a is the conspiratorial consequence of of um of of imperialist Jews and and then you also make a parallel case which I really also appreciate so first of all design this story is much more complex than the Jews are trying to steal the Middle East that's for sure but then there's an ideological issue too which is that on the radical left in particular there has developed this anti-colonial narrative that's predicated in part on the claim that every human relationship is predicated on Power and exploitation and then what seemed to happen was that that narrative which accounts let's say for the colonial activities of of of the westerners although it's curiously absent in claims about let's say the Ottoman Empire is that Israel is just written into history as another example of the same thing which is convenient for people that can only have one historical idea but doesn't seem to me to be very much in accordance with the with the historical process that actually gave rise to the Israeli State and if we look at you know again people you hear all of this people people talking about how it's sort of Israel is a European Colonial Venture in the Middle East it's a white occupation of a brown country so to speak and you know certainly the the herzl and his Zionist movement were strong among European Jews but the majority the largest groups in Israel today are not European they're Middle Eastern Jews many of them were actually driven out of their homes in the Arab world in retaliation for what happened to the Palestinians although these Jews who'd lived in Iraq for thousands of years or their ancestors in Egypt and so on had had nothing to do with either the Zionist movement or the or the war in Palestine they were driven from their homes as refugees and came to Israel and and these these people sort of get overlooked in the discussion of and there were about as many Jewish refugees from the Arab world more or less and people obviously argue about all these numbers and I'm not the great Arbiter of of everything here but sort comparable to the number of Palestinians who either fled or were driven out of Israel in the time of that war so it's and and these Jews who were the supporters by the way that that's the core of of prime minister netanyahu's support not the European Jews but the Middle Eastern Jews and the Russian Jews who have a different story but these Jews feel no guilt about the Palestinians hey he's a refugee I'm a refugee but where's the global sympathy for me where the the Jewish Refugee would say where is the United Nations with education for my child and free medical what have I ever gotten I'm called a colonizer right a European colonizer right yeah exactly and then on the other hand I was I was I visited uh Auschwitz some years ago and I saw a group of of group of teenagers following a star of David Flagg so I went to see what was going on they were Jewish teenagers visiting Poland because they were actually descended from polish Jews and they were coming back to see you know where where their ancestors had been and I said well how's the trip been going and they said well it's not been so good I said what do you mean I said well you know we went to visit the memorial in the Warsaw Ghetto you know the Jewish resistance against the Nazis and a crowd of people formed there and they were yelling Jews go home oh my God but you know they go to Palestine and it's ju you know they go back to Israel and people will say Jews go home to Poland Poland Jews go home to Palestine people have to have a home it definitely seems um what would you call it bordering on malevolent to regard the Jews who escaped from European persecution into Israel as European colonizers I mean you can say what you want about the British and the Hand they played in establishing Israel and you can you can make the case for the Palestinians that the U.N didn't have the right to do what it did and there's some there's there's some credibility to that argument but to regard European Jews fleeing Nazi Germany for example or Poland as European colonizers is I mean Jesus talk about pan in both directions at the same time well you know it's also true and and this is one of the things that in Ark of the Covenant just sort of I learned the most about and surprised me the most it turns out that Stalin had a lot more to do with the Jewish victory in the war of independence and the nakba the the Exile of the Palestinians then either the British or the Americans the the British actually sided with the Arabs in the Israeli War of Independence and they armed the Arabs and the and the Arab forces that were the most successful were the British Legion of British trained british-led british-equipped soldiers in the Jordanian Army uh and there you know they're the reasons that the West Bank was held by the Arabs until the 1967 war and on the other hand the Americans while we set all kinds of nice things about about the Israelis we put on an arms embargo that that meant that the desperate Israelis and for much of the war they were losing the war and they were being besieged in Jerusalem they couldn't buy weapons from the United States forget about American Aid to Israel they couldn't even buy with cash money we put in arms embargo Stalin ended up selling the through Czechoslovakia where the Czech arms Factory the skoda arms Factory in Czechoslovakia had been making weapons for the Vermont and when the Germans surrendered they had all these Surplus weapons in the factory to help the Communists take control of Czechoslovakia Stalin allowed the Czech government to sell these weapons these Nazi swore Surplus weapons to the Jews and smuggled them into British controlled Palestine and it was those weapons that allowed the Jews to turn the tide in the war so you know so to call this an act of Western colonialism uh you know this was if any you know call an act of Soviet colonies and the reason that Stalin did it okay was because he believed correctly that the emergence of a Zionist state in Palestine would so disrupt the British relations with the Arabs that it would it would dramatically weaken the power of Britain and the power of the British Empire in the Middle East he also thought rightly that it would help drive a wedge between the U.S and Britain so the whole story of you know the story that in people's minds this is the West imposing something of its Grand imperialist capitalist Colonial project it just doesn't match the historical record and of course in those days Israel was a left-wing cause right right and the Democratic socialists of America who are now extremely anti-israel for them in the 1950s Israel was proof that socialism worked right Israel's policies were you saw that with the glorification of the cabootses yes exactly and Israel had a planned economy and the labor unions were incredibly powerful Israel was far more left-wing in its Economic Policy than any even of the Social Democratic countries in Europe so when people said oh under socialism there's no Freedom the Democratic socialists of America say no Israel shows you're wrong do you think that part of the reason that the left has switched its uh position let's say in relationship to Israel is because Netanyahu went to war so to speak against a lot of these socialist predispositions and rekindled the Israeli economy towards something much more approximating a free market capitalist State yeah it was a combination of several things and this was a factor that in the 70s Israel goes from being a poster child of socialism to being a poster child of thatcherism and reaganism that those were the you know they began to introduce those economic reforms which have helped create in particular the incredibly Dynamic Tech sector that now gives Israel allies all over the world and will come to the Abraham Accords in a minute because this is a obviously a major factor yeah well netanyahu's claim is that these okay so he made two claims when I talked to him and uh not only obviously when I talked to him but one is that he worked very hard to make Israel a formidable military power but also worked very hard to make Israel a formidable capitalist Enterprise and that it was the combination of those two things that enticed or forced let's say the Arab states that did sign the Abraham Accords to go along they wanted Israel as an ally against Iran and so and Israel was powerful militarily and it showed its prowess in that regard but also because the Israeli economy had been freed from the strictures of an idiot centrally planned socialism it had become an industrial and technological Powerhouse rivaled perhaps now only by Silicon Valley and that also made the Israelis very attractive as trading partners to the Arab states that were interested in modernizing their economies so that's netanyahu's pitch what do you think of it well I think look I think claims fundamentally this is correct that that Israel thanks to its economic reforms but also thanks to some intelligent state it isn't let's say fair but you know the state has been very much involved in promoting its Tech sector but it is done essentially under capitalist principles and it's worked brilliantly and at this and and that then the tech Investments helped reinforce the economy overall but also increase military capability and this by the way uh is is a little bit worrying globally in the old days when you spent money on defense it would weaken your civilian economy instead of building a school bus you would build a tank but increasingly today because so much defense capability is linked to I.T Advanced information processing and all kinds of stuff the sort a lot of that technology is dual use but also firms that are excellent in military planning in military investment are extremely powerful economically so in fact in in large defense budgets tend to promote economic growth rather than restrict it and that change I think is propelling the world in a dangerous direction towards more armed races and that's something to be genuinely to be confident about is it is it propelling the world to more you know pseudo-fascist collusion between large Enterprises at the Pinnacle of the state well you know it's well hopefully again this is going to be one of the tests of the 21st century it's clear that information and state power are very closely aligned and in some ways information is is becoming the currency of power and so you you certainly if you're the United States you don't want Tick Tock or Huawei to have access to all the data about your population and of course vice versa if you're China so one of the one of the kinds of fantasies maybe we had in the 1990s was that the tech Revolution would make National borders Obsolete and create a single Global Commons it doesn't look to me right now as if that's the way things are working that the tech Revolution May in fact be recreating blocks and and strong National entities yeah well I think I think I think the idea of a centralized Global control Elite and a mass of citizens at their beck and call is a Tower of Babel model yes you see this in AI systems as well for for an AI system to process information about the world properly it has to have a very differentiated hierarchy of distributed computation there can't just be a centralized what would you say algorithmic system operating on the basis of a few algorithmic principles and then an undifferentiated massive activity and the the proper model for governance has to be something like I think something like the Catholic principle of subsidiarity where you have sovereignty inherent in various strata of the hierarchical system and that the hierarchy is quite deep and dense and differentiated and so the problem with the globalist view is that there's this notion that you can have a centralized cabal that can make relatively simple centralized decisions and all the power that should be distributed in all these subsidiary organizations can be accrued to the central Authority that just can't work and so there's going to be a place for something like Sovereign Nation States because you want governance to operate as locally as you possibly can so you need countries you need States you need provinces you need towns you need municipalities you need families and every single one of those levels of organization have to be given their due in with regard to political and economic power yes I I have an overwhelming amount of information isn't going to eliminate that yeah so that's the problem with the globalist vision as far as I can tell what do you think of the Abraham Accords well I think it's broadly speaking I think basically um in some ways the story that you told I think is the right Story the thing I would add you know which is to say that the you know the Arabs and the Israelis are both looking at Iran and by the way down the road they might be looking at Turkey because remember the Ottoman Empire ruled both Palestine and the Arab world for hundreds of years and as erdogan has tried to revive this idea of an Islamic turkey he's made a lot of his neighbors quite nervous so the sense is well Iran might be the threat today turkey tomorrow but yes the Arabs and the Israelis Now understand that they have a core strategic interest in common neither one of them wants any country to be able to dominate the Middle East because if any country did uh it would directly threaten the independence of both the Arab states and Israel now they didn't recognize this in the past because many Arabs had this dream that there could be an Arab state that would dominate the Middle East that was Saddam Hussein's Vision it was nassar's Vision in his kooky way it was Gaddafi's Vision but this pan-arabic or in some cases pan-islamist vision of the Middle East that is sort of the Arabs have lost faith in that by and large and so there is an understanding that their interests in Israel's interests are connected in this very geopolitical way but at the same time uh you've got the problem of energy transition the the gulf Arabs in particular used to think hey we've got all this oil it's going to be around forever now they're not so sure you know will we still be using an oil driven economy in 100 years Etc and with all of these talks about carbon neutrality and so on by 2030 2040 whatever year I mean I'm a little skeptical that all of these things are going to happen in the in the ways yeah they're not good they're definitely not going to happen I mean the Biden Administration itself has projected that it'll take till 2240 to produce something like 100 Reliance on renewable energy right so these ideas that we're going to get there by 2050 they're they're not only Preposterous they are outright lies right but even so the Arabs have to figure because on the other hand they've got fracking and they've got you know greater competition from other sources the Arab have to figure the price of oil their income from oil over the long term is going to be trillions of dollars less than they once thought it would that there's a long-term downgrade for income streams from oil and so that means in a country like Saudi Arabia where the population is growing and the government in order to stay in power needs to keep the people happy in some way you've got to be thinking about economic growth well that means you need technology it means you need investment it means you you need to have good relations with the people who are good at this so there's an economic Dimension to that as well of real that's new and that is added now to the Strategic the third thing though and I think some of the Americans involved in the Abraham Accords have not talked about this as much but it's real is that neither the Arabs nor the Israelis trust the Americans as much as they used to um and it's you know it's partly because of things like the Iran nuclear deal that they thought was sacrificing their interest to America's interests but it's also you know we elect bush in 2001 then we'll turn around 180 degrees we elect Obama then eight years later we turn around we elect Trump and then four years later we elect Biden so people in countries who where America plays a large role in their security they have to think harder than before about well we don't know who the Americans are going to elect in 2024. will it be Elizabeth Warren will it be Donald Trump again you know they have no idea what we'll do and frankly we don't either so um so they that means that they have to work together more so American weakness actually helped push the Abraham Accords so one of the disappointments um that I've experienced in relationship to the Biden Administration was what I saw as their ideologically motivated rejection of the advances made on the Abraham Accord front from what I've been able to understand the Saudis were playing a large role behind the scenes in pushing the abrahamic chords forward and it seems to me that had the Biden Administration gone to the Saudis with an attitude that would have unfortunately also allowed Trump to claim some credit for the Abraham Accords if this Biden administration had gone to the Saudis with with open arms in some sense that they might have been the next signatories for the Abraham Accords and it looked to me like the Biden Administration let an extremely narrow-minded parochial ideological view of both Trump and the situation in the Middle East Scuttle an unbelievably promising opportunity not only on the Peace front but I mean Americans were also very much interested in getting their hands on some additional Saudi oil which they seem to have failed at dismally and then had to turn to you know lovely lovely regimes like Venezuela so what do you think's going on with regards to the Biden Administration and the Saudis in relationship to the Abraham Accords well you know this is this is a really interesting story and it's a complicated one but I'll tell it as simply as I can which is that the Democratic party has been basically hating Saudi Arabia for 70 years um the last Democrat who really sort of liked the Saudis was Franklin D Roosevelt who visited in 1944 but um during the 1950s Democrats actually hated the Saudis in general because they were very pro-israel at the time and they saw the Eisenhower Administration which tilted toward Nassar and in general toward the Arabs well this is you're preferring a bunch of evil feudal monarchs over Democratic Israel because you want the oil and the oil monopolies right are your friends so to be a good liberal Democrat was to hate the Saudis and hate Eisenhower for liking them then you come to OPEC you know the 1970s and now you have the oil cartel I think we've been protecting you from the Soviet Union and your enemies and you turn on us and you're jacking up the price and at that time sort of working class America was basically Democratic and the price of oil triple at a time when people are getting like 10 miles a gallon in a car and it was wrecking people's lives and it was the Saudis who were doing it then you add sort of you know then um 911 comes along and there were the Saudis but plus the Saudis were friends of the bushes the Bush family had a long connection with the Saudi royal family obviously Hanky Panky is at work it's the evil it's the evil then now on top of all of that comes oil and the greenhouse gases the Saudis are destroying the world because they're pumping all that oil into the atmosphere and any good relationship with the Saudis is is sort of bowing the knee to Big oil into the destruction of human life through climate change I'm exaggerating but you can see what I mean right right well you also saw widespread Saudi re support for the wahhabis as well and they're they're drug beating on behalf of a pretty damn restrictive form of of fundamentalist Islam exactly but it looked to me like so so okay so that's a perfect storm but it still looked to me like the American choice in the last five years was something like well is it Iran or is it the Saudis and the Israelis right and it seems to me that despite the sins of the Saudis which are manifold the idea that they're not preferable to the Iranians is a form of political Insanity well I think we also need to throw in a factor here which is you know there's been a huge Scandal recently about Qatari influence in the European Parliament uh where they've actually arrested the vice president of the former vice president of European Parliament and so on and so forth um there the qataris are very anti-saudi they've had a huge fight with the Saudis in recent years they also have a kind of a softer relationship with Iran they are heavily and you know heavily involved in the Washington policy Network the head of a major Think Tank sort of got into big trouble because of a relationship so there's a sense in which you know I right all sides in the Gulf with a lot of money are put themselves into Washington politics and acquire networks of allies let's just say so there's and and the Democratic side of the spectrum is more aligned with soft on Iran uh uh pro-democracy is a little bit tilting toward the Muslim Brotherhood again I'm not saying everybody does this but if you watch Washington politics you can see some threads moving forward okay what but what what in the world is the rationale for being soft on a rat like I I I don't see a rationale for that at all I mean Iran is a terrible repressive theocracy with nuclear ambition it's a dangerous regime so how can you be soft on Iran well okay may I may I call you Jordan by the way or Mr Peterson you you certainly made all right well I and I'm Walter by the way it's after two hours I think we should but I think we could do that um but I think that uh look if you believe and a whole generation has come to believe uh in the U.S and not entirely for bad reasons like the Iraq War was the worst mistake America has made in the 21st century people would say that and a war with Iran would be even worse than a war than the war in Iraq and it's very easy to start a war with Iran but once it's going on you know it'll it'll suck a stride it'll divert us from China the Middle East will be a flame etc etc so your number and and furthermore we got to get out of the Middle East and think about China Okay so what's the biggest danger what is the biggest way you easiest way to get into a war in the Middle East it would be a confrontation with Iran therefore you can't have a confrontation with Iran that's the way I think a lot of people are thinking and I think you know and they're saying and they will say and now I'm you know I I can't tell you this is what they think because they can't read their minds but I think the logic of the position is we have to say we don't want an Iranian nuclear weapon but actually if you're given a binary choice between a war with Iran with the U.S fighting Iran to keep it from being not nuclear and then or just hoping that if they get a nuclear weapon we can deter them and Israel can deter them like everybody else's with nuclear weapons has been deterred they would say better let them have the bomb than have the War I think that's the the logic of the position and that the Iranians smelling that as the logic of the position have taken a very tough line in negotiations and at this point our con are continuing to press the Biden Administration that's what I think is probably happening okay okay we've wandered over a lot of territory we talked about China we talked about Russia we talked about Iran we talked about the Abraham Accords we talked about the complexities of the Israel Palestinian situation so we've covered a lot of the territory I was hoping we would cover is there anything that is remaining that you'd like to bring people's attention to well you know there there's been such a there's been a great conversation I really enjoyed it um and we touched on so many things I guess I would like to close by giving a bit of a reason for optimism for folks because you know the world situation is grim and there's there is real danger of War but this anglo-american 300 year old system of a kind of a commercial capitalist Global liberal framework it it it it doesn't just stay there by accident there are solid reasons why the world order that we've known you know we it's possible that it can continue lasting who knows how long but they're forces that prop it up one of them and we've talked about this sum is that a diversified Society with capitalist principles actually is incredibly creative and vital and keeps coming up with new technologies New Economic productivity new ideas new institutions that enable it to continually adjust to changing conditions and that gives it tremendous advantages over people who try to follow other systems or other approaches the other Advantage is geopolitical see America is a sea power you know we are we're not trying we don't we don't have any interest in conquering France much as much as there's some really nice places in France we we're you know we don't you know we Occupied Japan after World War II but we got out we did not want to stay and you know so that but on the on the contrary land powers like the Soviet Union keeps ex they keep expanding and they want to dominate their neighbors in a way that a sea power just isn't going to do so when a country like Russia or Iran or China begins to threaten its neighbors they all want to be allies of ours so as China has become more threatening we can see how Japan is suddenly either doubling their defense budget they are deepening their relations with Australia with India you know they're really working very hard to build the alliance the Indians are waking up and getting very geopolitically active so this the the Abraham Accords pop up in the Middle East the polls and the baltics are committed you know the swedes and the Finns want to join NATO so when this system is threatened by ambitious big Powers the other powers organize into alliances and this is not new this is how Britain defeated Louis XIV in the 16 and early 17th century it's how the British were able to defeat Napoleon it's what brought down Kaiser Wilhelm in World War one it's what brought down Hitler and Tojo in World War II and it's what defeated the Soviet Union so there are things on our side and we need the courage and the vision and maybe even a little bit of a knowledge of history that can help us understand and assess these incredibly threatening and dramatic Trends in world history that we're living through well I think that's an excellent way of ending this on that optimistic note yes I do think that the principles upon which this lengthy anglo-american productive piece have been predicated are Rock Solid particularly compared to all known Alternatives and it is useful for us in the west to observe that and to take heart in it and also to understand that the degree to the degree that those fundamental principles have spread across the world what they've primarily produced in their aftermath is unparalleled productivity and abundance and peace and so we could we could have more of that and I also think that that's within our grasp so that's a nice optimistic projection for 2023 and hopefully calm and stable and wise heads will prevail thank you very much for talking me to me today and to all of you who are watching on YouTube or listening on the associated podcast platforms thank you for your time and attention I'm going to turn now for an additional half an hour to the Daily wire plus platform I'm going to talk to Mr Walter Russell Mead about his biographical progress I'm very interested in delineating out the particulars of successful people's lives um it's always it always makes an interesting story and I think it's useful for people to understand how a productive Destiny makes itself manifest across a life course and so that's what we're going to do thank you to the Daily wire plus people for facilitating this conversation and uh Happy New Year to all of you who are watching and listening thanks again Walter for the conversation today hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on dailywireplus.com


大家好，我將在1月和2月再次巡迴演出，實際上一直到5月底，討論我的最後一本書，還有幾個地方的門票，我想我今天可以讓大家注意到加拿大渥太華1月30日在加拿大輪胎中心，美國華盛頓州埃弗雷特2月19日在風之天使體育館。19日在風之天使競技場，所以如果你在這些地區，或者你可以去那裏，並且你有興趣聽我談論我的書，試圖擴展其中的想法，那麼請你在1月30日到渥太華或2月19日到華盛頓的埃弗雷特，你可以在我的網站jordanbpeterson. 我希望能在那裏見到你。好吧，對伊朗軟弱的理由是什麼呢？所以你不能和伊朗對抗 我想很多人都是這麼想的 但我認爲這個立場的邏輯是 我們必須說我們不想要伊朗的核武器 但實際上如果你要在和伊朗的戰爭中做出二選一的選擇 美國與伊朗開戰以防止其沒有核武器，或者只是希望如果他們獲得核武器，我們可以威懾他們，以色列可以威懾他們，就像其他擁有核武器的國家被威懾一樣，他們會說讓他們擁有核彈比戰爭更好，我認爲這就是這個立場的邏輯。伊朗人嗅到了這一立場的邏輯，在談判中採取了非常強硬的態度 目前，我們的代表繼續向拜登政府施壓 這就是我認爲可能發生的事情 國外 我在華盛頓的一個晚宴上遇到了沃爾特-拉塞爾-米德先生 他是一位多產的作家 他是《華爾街日報》的專欄作家，是一位非常精明的外交事務評論家 我今天和他談的是美國及其西方盟友所經歷的世界局勢，比方說，我們要談的是俄羅斯、中國、伊朗、以色列和巴勒斯坦等問題 沃爾特-拉塞爾-米德先生是一位學術界的作家教授，正如我所說，他的工作重點是國際政策和外交事務，他是巴德學院外交事務和人文科學的詹姆斯-克拉克-蔡斯教授，在耶魯大學教授美國外交政策。 米德曾是《華爾街日報》等出版物的專欄作家，也曾是《美國利益》的總編輯，他的書包括《凡人的輝煌》、《特殊的天意》、《權力的恐怖》、《和平與戰爭》、《上帝與黃金》以及最近的《約櫃》，所以米德先生你花了很多時間思考外交政策的許多不同方面，不一定集中在世界的任何特定地區，而是儘可能地採取相對的全球視角，所以也許我們可以通過讓你總結一下你認爲的問題來開始我們的討論 所以也許我們可以在討論開始時，讓你總結一下你認爲最重要的問題是什麼 2022年美國和西方世界在對外關係方面面臨的最重要的問題，也許我們還可以談談你認爲2023年將會發生什麼，當我們向前推進時，目前在西方國家的外交政策方面有什麼困擾 這是個你知道這是一個非常困難的時期，也許幫助人們瞭解世界上正在發生什麼很重要，那就是認識到世界政治的基本框架是什麼。大約300年前開始，英國人開始建立這種全球商業秩序，有貿易就有商業，英國人也關心在歐洲建立權力平衡，並在全球範圍內發展他們的權力，以便這種商業海洋體系得以發展，美國人或多或少地繼承了或有人說在二戰結束後接管了這個體系，這種自由的國際海洋商業體系的貿易和政治關係的權力是世界政治中的主導現實。世界或多或少分爲兩類：一類是對這個體系相當滿意的國家，希望看到它繼續存在；另一類是對這個體系有不滿的國家，希望調整這個體系，但基本上願意在這個體系內工作；還有一類是想把整個體系搞垮的國家。 但部分原因是像中國這樣的國家已經發展起來，變得更加強大，但更根本的原因是美國人和我們的親密盟友沒有很好地理解如何建立、培育和維護這個體系 我們看到反對派的危機逐漸逼近，2022年，俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭 2022年，中國繼續對臺灣進行威脅，伊朗拒絕加入JCPA，與俄羅斯的聯盟不斷加深，我們看到這個修正主義大國的聯盟正在對這個國際體系形成真正的挑戰。 美國的勢力範圍並不明顯 我的意思是，中國是一個極其可怕的極權共產主義國家，伊朗基本上是一個法西斯政權，而俄羅斯在某種程度上似乎是一個例外，但你知道，因爲至少在名義上它可以與西方結盟，但自從冷戰結束後，它肯定以新的方式證明是非常有問題的，所以我的意思是，像中國和伊朗這樣的國家有什麼理由可以提供任何替代英美勢力範圍的東西呢？ 讓我們從中國開始好了，你知道中國提供了什麼，或者至少提供了什麼，因爲它提供的東西已經越來越沒有吸引力了 呃，隨着極權主義的發展，他們所處的經濟困境，以及他們對覬覦的反應，他們在說，看，你不必爲了變得富有和強大而購買西方的套餐，此外，他們對某人說，像津巴布韋或其他國家的統治者會給你錢，會給你技術，我們不會問你任何關於你兄弟--的錢有多少。 沒有討厭的審計師，我們會 你知道我們不像英國人那樣 我們不像英國人，我們不會試圖讓你做什麼，我們會讓你做的是，它將授權你做你想做的事 現在這不是一個替代世界秩序的積極議程，但它是一個提議，很多政府或很多有權勢的個人可能會發現有吸引力 是的，有權勢的和腐敗的個人，我的意思是，它是爲好的，所以讓我們把它拆開一點 所以第一部分是主張 你實際上可以變得富有，或者說擁有豐富的資源，爲你的公民提供合理的生活水平，而不是爲你自己，而不採用類似於西方道德準則的基本形而上學，這個主張讓我覺得非常不可能，因爲中國之所以富有，是因爲它設法與西方融合，基本上採用了準 我不認爲他們的體系是穩定的，我不認爲他們能夠將這種福祉傳播到未來，你自己也說過，中國在紀曉嵐的領導下已經向極權主義嚴重傾斜，這是很明顯的。 他們只能向腐敗的政府兜售他們的商品，你說他們在獨裁者方面的盈利能力，也表明他們的產品在道德上的破產，所以如果中國能提供的是把世界上腐敗的獨裁者聚集在一起的能力，這似乎不是一個非常合理的、可持續的替代英美統治的方法。 幾個世紀以來，很多人都試圖撼動它，你可以追溯到法國的路易十四，他說我要建立一個中央集權的強大的計劃經濟，我們將擁有英國所有的經濟和軍事力量，但我們不會有那些混亂的政治自由主義，但它沒有成功，但他打了一場漂亮的仗，讓世界震動了很多年，拿破崙真的完全是在挑戰那個英美世界。 說我的獨裁我的開明獨裁可以創造一個強大的經濟，讓愚蠢的英國人無法比擬，還有一支他們無法打敗的軍隊，他橫衝直撞了好一陣子，最終還是崩潰了，而且是正確的，我認爲德皇威廉二世我認爲希特勒東條和斯大林都以他們不同的方式有同樣的想法，即那種技術專家的獨裁集中權力和計劃可以挑戰創造一個社會的經濟，可以挑戰這個英國的 他們都失敗了，但他們都認爲，我從過去的經驗中吸取了教訓，現在我會贏的，我認爲中國也在按照這些思路思考。
我總是看到在美國發生的事情是，雖然你們有80%的時間是瘋狂的，在五個不同的方向上走偏了，但在美國總是有人在做一些瘋狂的創新的瘋狂的事情，所以似乎發生的事情是，美國被各種形式的政治白癡衝上了岸，但在美國有如此多的方法多樣性。 特別是考慮到其龐大的人口和聯邦制度以及真正的自由，某個地方的人正在做下一件正確的事情，那麼美國就是你所說的......開放和適應性強的國家。 思想足夠開放，適應性也足夠強，所以如果有人在做正確的事情，那麼他們就會極快地產生模仿者，美國人就會瘋狂地利用這一點，你就會得到這樣的情況，你可以想象，我想日本人也曾管理過一段時間，你可以想象，如果你只是碰巧發現了正確的願景，如果你是一個高效和仁慈的極權主義者，你可以在五年內更加有效。 如果你是一個高效和仁慈的極權主義者，你可以在五年的時間裏更加有效，但你會在權力交接方面遇到麻煩，這是一個致命的問題，然後如果世界對你的轉變不是以與你的意識形態願景不相稱的方式進行的，那麼你就沒有其他方法可以依靠，我的觀察是，所有這些試圖與這種分佈式和創造性的自由英美精神競爭的國家都被毀了。 我認爲這有一個生物學上的原因，那就是你知道生物系統計算適應性的方法之一是產生非常多的變異後代，而這些後代大部分都會滅亡。 美國的制度，因爲它是分佈式的，因爲它把大量的權力放在個人和附屬組織的手中，它的中長期創造力根本無法被擊敗，而且它的效率很低，你知道美國生產的很多變體。 美國生產的很多企業等都失敗了，但那些成功的企業可以取得驚人的成功，而且這種情況不斷發生，這似乎是一種不可阻擋的力量，你知道你剛剛概述了300年的歷史，表明這些認爲中央計劃和效率將擊敗分佈式創造力的單一的中央集權主義者，他們 只是他們接二連三地犯錯，你會認爲最終我們學會了這是錯誤的，也許我們在某種程度上已經學會了。 好吧，我認爲這個圈子正在傳播國家或文化和個人，他們確實看到了這個優勢，但作爲一個歷史的學生，而不是生物學或心理學的學生，我看到的是我們繼續發生這些戰爭。所以你知道我可以說，我實際上相信中國的體系、俄羅斯的體系，以它自己的方式、伊朗的體系肯定不能真正按照他們的願望繼續下去，並且會在競爭中失敗，我看看我們已經看到的拿破崙戰爭和世界大戰的破壞性，所以我們這邊的問題不是簡單地等待 所以我們的問題不是簡單地等待我們的多樣性和創新會取得明顯的勝利 但我們必須努力管理或在外交政策和安全政策中努力防止新的災難性戰爭的發生 儘管我們最終會取得勝利的機會是非常大的 是的，在我看來，現在在中國方面 中國方面，我是說他們正經歷着國內的動盪，對中國來說，這似乎是前所未有的，在我看來，中國當局在臺灣問題上做一些類似於劍拔弩張的事情，來轉移民衆對國內失敗的注意力，這顯然符合他們的利益。這讓我覺得很悲觀 雖然很多人都在關注中國和臺灣 我是說G似乎在試圖以毛澤東這樣的人的方式來鞏固權力 他變成了一個真正的極權主義的獨裁者 而不是一個你知道的推動中國發展的人 或者說是一個懷疑的人 就像... ...那個實現現代化的中國領導人... ...他叫什麼名字？ 是的，沒錯，他不像是另一個鄧小平... ...他似乎更像是另一個毛澤東，這在臺灣方面是非常令人擔憂的。 所以你認爲中國方面的前景如何？對，不，這很有意思，因爲從中國人的角度來看，首先我們要明白，像我和你這樣從中國來的人，並不代表中國的廣大人民羣衆，一般的中國人都沒有離開過中國，沒有在美國或加拿大的大學裏學習過幾年英語。 對他們來說，這看起來非常令人沮喪，他們認爲中國是一個偉大的國家，經濟不斷增長，是世界上人口最多的國家，至少在印度趕上之前是這樣，然後他們看到，看看伊朗，一個小國在很多方面都比中國落後，它一直在中東地區橫行霸道，在敘利亞，在黎巴嫩，在也門，到處製造麻煩。你看，連俄羅斯都得到了克里米亞，並取得了一些成就，而中國政府呢，它做了什麼呢？ 答案是，它做的比伊朗少，比中國少，在擴張方面比俄羅斯少，所以我認爲中國政府受到了很多中國公衆輿論的壓力，如果我們像你說的那樣偉大，爲什麼你不更有效呢？很多中國人認爲中國在世界上的地位應該是這樣的，而他們實際看到的是這樣的。正如你所說的，在這個壓力巨大的時候，他們把夢寐以求的政策鎖定了多年，現在他們仍然有大規模的流行病，嗯，住房市場，這是大多數中國人的儲蓄和投資的地方，房價已經下降了近三年，中國的財政出現了重大危機。我只是想知道你對拜登政府對臺灣局勢的反應的評價，你對拜登制定的對華外交政策有什麼看法，我認爲到目前爲止，拜登政府在臺灣和美國的信息傳遞方面做得相當好。 它正在施加經濟壓力，它正在試圖阻止滲透，你知道中國的增長實際上來自於對知識產權的盜竊，來自於中國國家對企業的補貼，你知道這些企業在關鍵部門能夠利用這些補貼在世界其他地方進行不公平的競爭，我們開始看到這一點，你知道它開始於特朗普時代，甚至奧巴馬總統談到了對亞洲的支點，所以在美國已經有越來越多的意識。 在美國，人們越來越意識到需要更多地關注中國，而不僅僅是坐在這裏等待資本主義把中國變成民主國家，這也許是我們在20年前所做的事情，所以我們在這方面肯定是領先的[音樂]隨着新年的開始，還有什麼比現在開始建立一個祈禱的習慣更好的時間呢，就像體育鍛煉一樣，每天的精神鍛鍊對你的福祉至關重要，特別是在一個每天都在我們周圍發生的對信仰和宗教的攻擊的世界裏，Hallow是美國第一大基督教祈禱應用，也是美國第一大天主教應用。 它充滿了學習冥想和反思，包括一年中排名第一的基督教播客《聖經》，你可以在 hallow.com Jordan上免費下載該應用程序，你可以設置祈禱提醒，邀請其他人與你一起祈禱，並跟蹤你的進展，使今年成爲你的精神成長和和平的一年，在 hallow.com Jordan上獲得三個月的獨家免費試用。 在我年輕的時候，中國發生了什麼？首先，當我開始有政治意識的時候，我們可以說是在20世紀70年代，我記得去了埃德蒙頓阿爾伯塔省的一個貿易展覽會，那是中國人最早參加的貿易展覽會之一，大概在1974年左右，我們去看了一下，中國人在那裏展示了他們的工業產品，看起來像是第二次世界大戰後在西方製造的東西。但那是我有生以來第一次看到中國的東西，當然在我很小的時候，饑荒的威脅仍然是我們與中國聯繫在一起的東西。可以說，隨着中國製造業質量的提高，大量廉價的消費品湧入西方國家，就像日本一樣，在很長一段時間裏，中國人似乎要與我們並駕齊驅，即使是作爲競爭者和合作者，讓我們都走向一個相對一體化的資本主義未來。中國人將逐漸轉變爲在同一體系下的盟友 我認爲這在過去幾十年裏確實是以一種非常樂觀的方式發生的 直到她決定集中控制並把自己變成另一個毛澤東 這並不明顯，西方對中國的樂觀主義是錯誤的 我是說我認爲西方的工作條款爲整合中國付出了很大代價，但除此之外
你知道中國人不再捱餓了，這當然是一個很大的好處，就像試圖讓中國人融入世界經濟有很多積極因素，但缺點是我們似乎變得更加依賴他們的慷慨和善意，而不是我們所需要的，當然中國作爲一個極權主義模式是國際秩序中的一股不穩定力量。我的一些書被翻譯成中文，我在中國的大學裏演講，與教授和官員交談，你剛纔表達的觀點是非常普遍的，這就是他們認爲中國正在做的和應該做的，就是走向這種整合，成爲一些中國人曾經告訴我的正常國家，就是他們希望中國成爲的。但我認爲在某些方面發生的事情是，我們往往忘記中國共產黨是一個真正的東西，它想掌握權力，你知道，有很多人看到，你知道他們看中國的歷史，是的，共產黨殺死的中國人比世界歷史上任何東西都多，他們因毛澤東的饑荒和其他事情而死亡，甚至遠遠超過了抗日戰爭的死亡人數。但正如你所指出的，中國過去30-35年的經濟增長是人類歷史上最偉大的奇蹟之一 是的，你必須要有一顆石頭般的心，才能不爲數以億計的人擺脫貧困而感到高興 新的生活方式正在形成，新的文化教育機會正在出現 這是生活，也是我們應該做的，這是進步，也是好事，但社會的進步我想讓共產黨感到恐懼，因爲他們可以看到自己失去控制，可以看到 在中國的歷史和文化中，它是一個擁有十億四千萬人口的國家，相當於歐盟人口的四倍，所以中國的歷史是一個中央和地方政府平衡的故事，他們曾經有過分裂、戰爭和軟弱的時期，當中央政府軟弱的時候，別人就會利用它。擔心事情會失去控制，甚至在我們看到國際敵意之前的幾年，我們看到的是在一個又一個部門，他們逐漸收緊了對中央共產主義精英的控制，在習近平一個人的領導下，他們收緊了一切，利用一切可以利用的手段，在中國強加統一，甚至在公司裏重新確定，現在每個公司都必須有一個共產黨的賣家，所以我們的部分。是的，作爲一個西方投資者，這是很困難的事情，當你的公司被共產黨的小組管理的時候，你是否真的擁有這個公司，所以這是一個對的，對的，所以他們正在從一個好的時期進入一個更困難的時期，我想是的，我也認爲人們在1989年之後是樂觀的，正確的，因爲一旦蘇聯放棄了幽靈，在相當長的一段時間裏，你不能再打共產黨的主意了 正如蘇聯在其內部愚蠢行爲的重壓下崩潰一樣，中國共產黨也註定要最終失敗，現在當然如此。 和激進的左派世界觀之間的矛盾，我的意思是，我們自己的社會充滿了這種文化戰爭，至少在資本主義本質上是壓迫性的，西方文化也是如此，當然，中國共產黨人也相信這一點，如果我們不能把我們自己的房子整理好，在某種意義上，這些想法的病理學在西方，中國人仍然被他們支配，這並不奇怪。 我的意思是，我所看到的情況是，在西方，特別是在美國，人們正在失去他們所需要的東西，這不是什麼好事。 特別是在美國，人們對中國這個貿易伙伴失去了信心，我們開始撤回大量的製造能力，減少投資，遠離中國這個貿易伙伴，當然，這隻會使中國的情況更加絕望，這不是一件好事。我們在西方把1989年和蘇聯的事件看成是一個光榮的勝利，但在中國和普京是在他們的波長上，他們看到的是非常不同的，看看蘇聯，戈爾巴喬夫試圖自由化，把一些民主元素引入蘇聯，看看發生了什麼，蘇聯 蘇聯分崩離析 俄羅斯在十年內一貧如洗 失去了在世界上的大國地位 他們在俄羅斯和中國看到的西方就像在他們身上走來走去，爲所欲爲 所以伊朗人也看到了這一點 所以給這些領導人的信息是不要自由化 自由主義是一種毒藥，即使有一點 如果你讓它進入你的社會，它就會破壞你的權力，摧毀一切 所以他們實際上變成了 他們沒有說哦，西方民主是多麼迷人 他們說它是多麼危險 我們聽到普京抱怨，談論顏色革命 在後蘇聯國家的不同自由化革命 他們認爲我們，他們認爲西方引領了這種顛覆，西方的思想和西方的自由是對他們自己權力的根本威脅，考慮到他們中的一些人利用這種權力爲他們的個人生存服務，是的，雖然這對極權主義者來說似乎是一個合理的擔憂，但對於有意識形態動機的極權主義獨裁者來說，西方的自由主義理想絕對不會提供一個環境，讓他們的變態權力遊戲能夠成功，是的。我認爲我們的錯誤在於沒有意識到，我們不是在說，我們要耐心等待中國的發展，但中國共產黨方面卻在說，我們不只是要耐心等待自由主義的發展。我們不會耐心等待，直到自由主義來破壞我們，我們會先發制人地做我們需要做的事情來維持我們的權力，所以我想，也許我們應該知道，因爲他們從未動搖過對朝鮮的支持。他們總是說我們要的是經濟自由化而不是政治自由化 是的，就像那些... ...好吧，讓我們專注於這個問題 對我來說，沒有政治自由化就有經濟自由化是不明顯的 事實上，我認爲事件的順序是相反的... ...在西方，我們之所以有富裕和物質繁榮是因爲自由主義 自由主義不是財富的結果，而是財富的前提條件，如果你能考慮到這點 特別是關於私人財產權和對自己勞動成果的權利 如果你的社會不是建立在個人在某種程度上具有內在價值和主權的想法上，那就不僅僅是國家的禮物，而是個人內在的東西 只要你有了這個，你至少在原則上就有了不可侵犯的權利，接近於私人財產和自己的勞動成果，如果沒有這個基本假設，我認爲最重要的是一個司法 因爲它是如此依賴信任和誠實，例如，真正的繁榮和私人財產的權利，它只是一個不穩定的因素，所以這是一個西方最喜歡的說法是，我們可以擁有所有的經濟繁榮，甚至更多的經濟繁榮，有一個集中的自上而下的控制系統。 但在現實中，這似乎永遠不會實現，所以我不認爲我的意思是，你可以指出像新加坡這樣的政權是一個潛在的例外，但新加坡的歷史並不長，所以我們會看到它在權力交接等方面的表現，但認爲你可以有經濟進步的想法 我不認爲有任何歷史證據可以證明這一點，而且有很多相反的證據，你用獨裁國家的不斷失敗來描述它，有趣的是，我的意思是，我認爲你是對的，你知道人性的存在是這樣的 私有財產和個人權利的文化，加上誠實，是更大繁榮的基礎，但世界上不同文化的基礎與這套理念的關係非常不同，你知道我記得我第一次開始在俄羅斯旅行時，還是蘇聯的時候 呃，我想我正在泄露我的年齡，但我在那裏注意到的一件事是，馬克思主義在文化上對俄羅斯的許多人有吸引力，因爲人們對經濟交流有一種深深的不信任，人們直觀地感到，如果你至少是這樣的，在我看來，如果一個商人到農村去買一蒲式耳小麥
如果一個商人到鄉下以5盧布的價格買了一蒲式耳的小麥 然後拿到城裏以10盧布的價格賣給城裏的消費者 他就是在欺騙別人 也許他在欺騙農民 也許他在欺騙顧客 但這種交換在道德上是不合法的 所以馬克思主義在我們心中的感覺是正確的 你知道資本主義的本質是剝削 很多人被誘導去相信 羨慕是一種致命的罪過，比方說... ...很容易就會羨慕那些似乎擁有你所沒有的東西的人... ...特別是如果你不喜歡看別人的全部生活... ...你看到他們生活中的一個特點，在某種程度上超過了你所能做到的 然後你就會認爲，如果有人在某個方面的成就超過了你，那麼他們之所以這樣做，是因爲他們是腐敗和邪惡的，而不是因爲他們與你相比是有用的和有生產力的，這也是非常方便的。因此，嫉妒的馬克思主義所具有的心理優勢之一是，它以一種極其強大的可怕方式發揮了嫉妒的作用，其問題似乎是，也許這是經濟發展的另一個原則，如果你的社會是建立在所有成就或社會經濟地位的差異是盜竊和剝削的結果的想法上，那麼基本上你建立了一個沒有人可以比其他人擁有更多的東西，在這種情況下，你沒有任何貿易的基礎，你當然不能產生任何近似財富，因爲 因爲每個人都不可能在同一時刻變得同樣富有，總是會有一個分配的等級。西方國家設法做到的一件怪事是，這與隱含的信任有關，我們實際上已經設法發展了一個社會，在那裏，人們不僅容忍不平等，而且對它有某種程度的欽佩，我的意思是，我認爲這在美國特別真實，加拿大和歐洲就不那麼真實。 在美國，人們對那些能夠在某些領域取得驚人成就的人有一種普遍的欽佩感，這與美國的父母希望他們的孩子能夠成爲一名合格的公民的願望有關。 在美國，父母希望他們的孩子也能取得同樣的成就，但任何社會能夠做到這一點，真的是一個奇蹟。人們對偉大的小提琴家或偉大的舞蹈家的欽佩之情是非同尋常的 因爲在生活的其他方面，他完全被黨腐蝕了 如果你有一份好工作，那是因爲共產黨給了你 如果你知道，如果你是一個工廠的主管，那是因爲你的兄弟 在 但在藝術領域，你知道那個小提琴家只是在上面演奏，你聽到了，這讓你 嗯，你知道，所以有這種與卓越的直接接觸。他比別人彈得好，所以他應該失去一根手指，然後他就不會比別人彈得好，但在這個經濟領域，不，他們你知道他們對外國的足球或美術品有非常不同的看法。 它可以幫助你在社交媒體市場上進行銷售，如Tick Tock Facebook和Instagram，你不需要成爲一個設計師，也不需要知道如何編碼，Shopify的行業領先的工具讓你完全控制你的業務和你的品牌。 com jbp all lowercase go to shopify.com jbp to take your business to the next level today that is shopify. com jbp好吧，讓我們把注意力轉移到俄羅斯人身上，這樣我們就知道或者說我們在低分辨率的意義上勾勒出了什麼在推動 呃，反動的中國人，這是對共產主義模式和極權主義國家的迴歸，這是由那些從這種扶持中受益的人推動的，這似乎相對清晰，俄羅斯方面則複雜得多，因爲普京是一個共產主義者並不明顯，例如，我知道杜根是誰，是誰的 我知道Dugan是普京最喜歡的哲學家，他一直試圖爲俄羅斯人勾勒出一種近似於不同的精神氣質，我知道其中一些實際上起源於陀思妥耶夫斯基和索爾仁尼琴，他們都以各種方式宣稱，俄羅斯的正確前進道路是回到類似於沿着東正教的道路逐步發展的狀態，我認爲俄羅斯人在某種程度上正在與之鬥爭，Dugan試圖勾勒出一種替代的精神氣質，但我沒有看到任何東西 除了對西方進步的自由主義過度的反感之外，我看不出俄羅斯人實際上已經成功地闡述了任何東西，大約創造了一個願景，那麼你認爲是什麼在驅使俄羅斯人呢？ 我認爲是對歷史的悲劇感 你知道俄羅斯的歷史是一個痛苦的事情，普京不是一個共產主義者，他是 呃，他是一個沙皇主義者，他是一個俄羅斯民族主義者，你知道他實際上討厭共產主義者 因爲列寧和列儂的民族政策在某些方面確實摧毀了俄羅斯帝國，創造了這個人造的蘇聯，而不是帝國，在赫魯曉夫領導下將克里米亞移交給烏克蘭，這就是普京真正喜歡的那種共產主義BS，但在今天的俄羅斯，有一些普京非常羨慕和懷念的東西，那就是共產黨在其大部分歷史上都在俄羅斯擁有一個意識形態，它有一個忠誠的線人和合作者網絡 所以每個街區都有人在監視別人的行爲，並向祕密警察報告壞人和可疑的活動，通過共產黨小組的網絡，青年組織，整個文化，政府有措施來控制塑造輿論。他試圖通過俄羅斯民族主義和東正教來尋找，當然，在大多數俄羅斯公民是穆斯林的地方，他試圖通過伊斯蘭宗教當局來工作，記住，東正教和穆斯林的等級制度在共產黨統治下完全由克格勃控制。所以當蘇聯解體時，所有克格勃的黑客和傀儡都已就位 當然，這裏和那裏也有一些真誠的信徒，但你知道，所以，所以有黑色的男性材料，你可以控制東正教會的方式，你控制和普京試圖把它變成國家控制的工具，現在你 在俄羅斯文化中，這並不像在我們看來的那樣不合法 因爲東正教會在其神學中總是更支持沙皇和皇帝 它來自於拜占庭傳統 凱撒和皇帝也是一個神聖的人物 所以他們在某些方面與傳統的俄羅斯思想相吻合 但是俄羅斯社會在過去的一百年裏發生了很大的變化 1920年的時候俄羅斯還是一個農民社會，今天則主要是一個城市社會 所以普京不具備控制意識形態的要素 普京的另一個問題是俄羅斯的東正教和俄羅斯的民族主義不像馬克思主義和列寧主義那樣在共產主義鼎盛時期出口，斯大林甚至可以依靠像美國的阿爾傑希斯和英國的金-菲爾比這樣的高級間諜的狂熱忠誠度 出於對共產主義的忠誠，他們願意成爲斯大林的代理人和傀儡 普京沒有這種能力，他希望通過反對一些瘋狂的事情，他和歐爾班以及其他一些人正試圖創造一種保守的傳統主義國際，可以爲他們做一些事情 就像國際共產主義者爲斯大林所做的那樣，但這是不可能的，這是不可能的，這是一個更弱的立場，但普京正在做他能找到的工具，使俄羅斯成爲一個大國，我認爲部分原因是它更弱，因爲如果你試圖將基督教神學與中央集權的準法西斯國家的想法聯繫起來 法西斯國家的想法，實際上效果並不好 因爲在猶太教的傳統中，對個人主權和個人價值的強調非常強烈 我的意思是，當《聖經》被印刷和分發，每個人都可以閱讀它的原文時，情況肯定是這樣的，人們認識到自己的內在價值，我們更有可能承擔起知情公民的權利和責任，只要他們變得有文化，並能理解這一傳統的含義。所以在我看來，普京根本不可能設法將基督教傳統與他應該成爲近似沙皇的想法結合起來，即使進步的西方國家已經在其過度行爲中播出了，它當然有，但這個故事似乎沒有什麼力量。
但這並沒有驅使他們投入普京這樣的人的懷抱 不，這只是一個非常... ...你知道的... ...又是一個非常俄國的傳統，沙皇幾乎是教會的領袖，也是國家的領袖 基督教的傳統在古老的俄羅斯東正教視野中被最小化了，它是一種更加集體主義的信仰，所以東正教歐洲和新教及天主教歐洲之間的差距是一個非常深刻的歷史，當它超過1000年的時候，嗯，所以普京把一些在俄羅斯有效的東西，至少在一段時間內是不能以普京希望的方式出口的，現在他有另一個選擇，他用這個自由地工作。 所以普京一方面要努力成爲那些反對西方進步主義的人的擁護者，但同時他又想獲得蘇聯支持的另一個來源，即反資本主義、反西方的個人主義，你知道極左派，而這兩件事正是普京在美國的工作。 有趣的是，你得到的人，你知道的，呃，小隊往往是非常懷疑美國的政策。 美國在烏克蘭的政策和極右翼的人一樣，現在有很多合理的問題，你可以問我們在烏克蘭做什麼和不做什麼，但這種同情，準普京的同情，你會發現它在反 你可以在左翼的反美人士以及右翼的一些傳統主義者中找到這種同情，這就是普京，普京不在乎，你知道，對他來說，他會利用他能找到的任何工具，這就是他對這些人的看法，不是把他們當作盟友和夥伴，而是當作工具來使用，以達到他的目的。他的目的是首先是最後，而且永遠是俄羅斯的國家權力 你認爲他在烏克蘭的目標是什麼？ 當我看到發生的事情時，我想了兩件事，我想了三件事 我想普京對西方向烏克蘭的擴張主義不是很滿意 他也非常願意擴大俄羅斯的統治範圍，特別是在烏克蘭東部地區，然後我也認爲有可能在某種根本意義上，他並不關心烏克蘭是否從這場衝突中被摧毀，只要它不落入西方的手中，但我仍然相對不清楚他對入侵的動機和願景，我的意思是，你認爲他認爲這將是一個小菜一碟，就像許多軍事領導人在他們進入外國時往往假定的那樣，或者普京到底是怎麼想的。 美國的情報部門也認爲他會贏 你知道美國人對澤林斯基說會給你一架飛機讓你逃走 我們告訴所有國家的大使離開，俄國人要來了，一片恐慌，所以我們給普京的信息不是威懾的信息，而是鼓勵的信息 我們認爲我們的情報非常好，它告訴我們你會贏的 如果你這樣做就會贏，所以你知道，這很有趣，我想他確實認爲他會很快獲得很大的成功，但至於烏克蘭對普京的威脅，並不像西方國家那樣，也不像西方國家可能在基輔有軍隊，很明顯，我們不想入侵俄羅斯，西方國家沒有人想入侵俄羅斯，沒有人，美國也不支持派軍隊進入俄羅斯，對嗎？這不在考慮之列 但在考慮之列的是 如果烏克蘭民主化併成爲一個成功的國家 普京對俄羅斯人民的整個論點是 你知道民主對英國人、法國人和美國人來說可能很有效 但我們俄羅斯人不同 我們是東正教斯拉夫人 我們有自己的傳統和自己的世界 基輔確實是俄羅斯文明的發源地 烏克蘭對俄羅斯人來說是他們的心臟地帶，如果烏克蘭的斯拉夫人在民主制度下幸福和繁榮，並實現腐敗的停滯不前的普京政權在俄羅斯無法實現的事情，一個幸福的民主的烏克蘭不用動一個手指頭，不用在邊境上打一槍，就能對普京在國內的權力和願景造成致命的威脅，這就是問題所在。這是否意味着烏克蘭被摧毀和俄羅斯撤軍就是普京的勝利呢？ 普京希望烏克蘭失敗，他希望並被視爲在烏克蘭占主導地位，這是他需要的兩樣東西，也是他勝利的最低限度的理由 是的，還有克里米亞 好了，好了，現在你看到什麼了？我是說俄羅斯人已經被擊退了 但他們的武器裝備之強令人難以置信 面對最終壓倒性的核威脅，烏克蘭的勝利並不明顯 所以我已經聽到了紅色的暗示 普京是否感覺到壓力，要坐到談判桌前 嗯，你對未來一年事情的發展有什麼看法？ 我認爲我們，呃，我們在後面，戰爭已經經歷了幾個階段，重要的是要記住，我們已經很久沒有考慮過一場大型戰爭了，以這種方式，我們都忘記了一些正常的事情。其中之一是戰爭會發生變化 就像二戰中，你開始有10個月的青春期，沒有人做任何事情 然後希特勒征服了一切，哦，我的天哪，他要贏了，但隨後又陷入了僵局等等，它改變了，在這場戰爭中，最初階段是俄羅斯的進攻，人們有一段時間認爲這些可能會成功 然後烏克蘭的失敗，然後我們進入了一個漫長的時期，像緩慢的 在這場戰爭中，有一個最初的階段，人們認爲這些攻擊可能會成功，然後是烏克蘭的失敗，然後我們進入了一個長期的緩慢的俄羅斯推進階段，然後是令人振奮的烏克蘭反擊，每個人都說啊，他們的整個俄羅斯軍隊可能會瓦解，等等，他們似乎至少現在已經穩定了他們的前線，我們真的不知道，隨着導彈攻擊和俄羅斯你知道在邊界上的戰鬥，我們回到了磨人的消耗戰，或者因爲你知道俄羅斯軍隊的士氣在一些地方相當低，你知道我們會看到更多的軍事崩潰 我們會不會看到更多的軍隊崩潰 就像我們在俄羅斯那邊看到的那樣 所以現在有很多事情發生 英國人和俄羅斯人都認爲他們還有一些牌可以打 而且雙方都不願意放棄 除非他們認爲通過其他方式可以獲得更多的東西 所以現在雙方 你知道西方對澤林斯基說 來吧 至少看起來你想談一談 所以他說 我已經準備好坐下來討論和平問題了 基本上是俄羅斯完全撤軍和賠償 普京也感受到了一些內部壓力 至少要讓人覺得他對碎片有興趣 是的，我有興趣，我想就烏克蘭向我投降進行和談 所以我不認爲會有什麼變化，未來將取決於軍隊在地面上的表現 戰鬥之神將決定我們的位置，然後隨着現實的變化，雙方對他們可以合理地希望實現的目標的理解也會發生變化，在某些時候，也許會有我們看到的談判和平，但你認爲有相當多的 但你認爲在這之前還有很多戰爭要發生 因爲從根本上來說，雙方都沒有明顯的損失 對，還是很矛盾的 雙方都有理由相信自己能從現在的情況中獲益 只要是這樣，戰爭就會繼續下去 好吧，讓我們暫時把注意力轉移到伊朗的局勢上 我想談談那裏的兩個不同趨勢 首先是抗議活動，然後我們可以談談伊朗與以色列的關係，以及伊朗的核計劃 我在耶路撒冷的時候，會見了一些高級人士 多年來以各種方式爲以色列政府工作 他們中的一些人對伊朗迅速發展核彈的能力非常關注 我的理解是，他們仍在大量試驗複雜的離心機，旨在將他們推向發展核武器的地步，如果有必要的話，在幾個月內就可以實現，因此，在我看來，伊朗是以色列最根本的敵人，在某種真正意義上致力於消滅以色列，因此，這在某種意義上是非常令人擔心的。但與此相對應的是，伊朗人自己似乎對他們的國家感到非常厭煩，只有上帝才知道抗議活動會發生什麼，我的意思是，我們可能會很幸運，看到伊朗政權崩潰，儘管一個崩潰的政權往往會被一個更糟糕的政權取代，而不是一個更好的政權，所以無論如何，告訴我你對伊朗的看法。 

首先，我認爲對美國和以色列以及更廣泛的西方國家的敵意已經融入了當前伊朗政權的本質，因爲他們需要與美國有不好的關係，需要與以色列有不好的關係，如果沒有可怕的敵人來摧毀你，你還怎麼爲一個神職人員獨裁政權辯護？ 伊朗是一個多民族、多語言、多文化的國家，北部有大量的阿澤裏族人，伊朗的庫爾德人也像其他國家的庫爾德人一樣不安分，他們希望庫爾德人獨立，你有貝魯加風格，你有南方的街區，你有大量的阿拉伯人在伊朗，大部分的石油
中央政府希望繼續開採石油，但不是將收入用於阿拉伯省份，而是用於維持其在該地區的權力。例如，伊朗看到了蘇聯的情況，當蘇聯失去了對共產主義的信仰時，可以說支撐它的水泥就分崩離析了，所以伊朗政府非常擔心，如果沒有一種意識形態使之合法化並賦予中央政權權力，誰知道會發生什麼呢？尤其是其他國家，不管是土耳其、俄羅斯還是美國，誰都想把它的領土拉走，所以這也是他們不願意的原因之一 我認爲這種幻想，即我們可以和伊朗人達成協議，一切都會好起來，是不可能的。我還認爲，對伊朗人來說，把以色列作爲敵人是非常方便的，可以向巴勒斯坦人提供支持，使衝突繼續瘋狂地發展下去，因爲正如你所說，沒有什麼能幫助一個專制國家合法化的。所以你知道和平協議的先決條件之一是雙方都希望和平，而這在我看來一點都不明顯，正如你所指出的，伊朗的情況恰恰相反，當涉及到以色列時，他們又有了新的打算。我們談過伊朗的恐懼，它的希望是什麼 如果一個國家能控制波斯灣和那裏的所有石油 即使在其他地方有石油和替代能源的時代 這也是全球範圍內的巨大力量 你可以敲詐世界，伊朗人看着這些阿拉伯海灣小國 巴林是一個由遜尼派穆斯林統治的國家，但有很多什葉派教徒，在沙特阿拉伯還有少數什葉派教徒，所以伊朗真的看到了機會，看看它能做什麼，我想這要歸功於美國的愚蠢行爲 伊朗在敘利亞和黎巴嫩都有行動，在整個中東都有行動，在也門也有行動，但問題是，什葉派伊斯蘭教在遜尼派穆斯林中不受歡迎，被認爲是異端，波斯人也不是真的，阿拉伯波斯人的問題是真的，所以最反對的是以色列。 所以最反對以色列是一種宣傳方式 我討厭我們是這麼好的穆斯林，我們討厭以色列 不像所有這些討厭的海灣統治者願意妥協，所有這些我們都會死磕到底 如果你討厭以色列，你知道的，你愛伊斯蘭教，我們是你的領袖 他們不會放棄的，他們不會放棄的 如果其他阿拉伯人從巴勒斯坦人的暴力中走出來 那麼伊朗人會非常樂意填補這個空白，所以這是對的 我相信伊朗是有溫和派的，但我認爲權力結構的核心人物從恐懼和希望的角度看都是有道理的，他們不認爲改變有什麼好處。牧師的家是第一所學校，每天早上都會唱歌，基督教信仰是一個唱歌的宗教，今天可能有80%的斯克裏普斯的背誦都是因爲唱歌而存在的，這很驚人，我們有一本古騰堡聖經，是由約翰-戈珀的出版社印刷的，科學和宗教是世界上的對立力量，但在歷史上，情況並非如此。到現代教育、醫學和科學，再到文明本身，它是所有歷史上最有影響力的書，希望人們至少能帶着這種感覺離開，所以讓我們討論一下 嗯，其中一件事讓我印象深刻，我正在讀你的書，嗯，2022年出版的新書《盟約之弧》，它至少在很大程度上分析了與以色列和猶太復國主義國家以及巴勒斯坦有關的情況，我認爲你的書非常平均 我對亞伯拉罕協議方面的發展很感興趣，我採訪了一些與亞伯拉罕協議有關的人，從我所瞭解的情況來看，基本上發生的情況是，一羣與外交政策機構有關係的局外人決定推翻 傳統觀念認爲以色列人和阿拉伯世界之間的和平不可能不包括巴勒斯坦人，他們開始與阿拉伯國家談判，這些國家實際上對控制伊朗很感興趣，但也想與以色列人和平共處。由於戰略原因，部分原因是他們是一個主要的軍事強國，但也有經濟原因，因爲許多阿拉伯國家現在正在尋求使他們的經濟擺脫對石油美元的依賴，所以亞伯拉罕協議似乎發生了什麼，一大批阿拉伯國家決定，與以色列的和平絕對符合他們的最佳利益。我一直很同情以色列人在中東的行動，我在很大程度上被批評爲沒有考慮到對巴勒斯坦人的壓迫，而你的工作似乎在這方面是非常公平的。 在這方面，你在我們開始採訪之前評論說，你寫了一本關於一個非常有爭議的話題的書，所以這將是以色列和巴勒斯坦的局勢。 所以，這似乎表明，你在倡導猶太人與以色列的關係和指出世界上絕大部分猶太人都支持猶太復國主義計劃以及對流離失所的巴勒斯坦人給予一定程度的同情之間，取得了一種很好的平衡，也許你可以向我們介紹一下你對亞伯拉罕協議的看法以及你對以色列局勢的看法。 當然，讓我從以色列和巴勒斯坦局勢的根源開始說起 你知道，美國人實際上在猶太人之前就支持以色列了 非猶太人的美國人在19世紀90年代，在現代猶太復國主義的創始人特奧多爾-赫茲爾寫下他的《猶太國家》一書之前 美國總統收到一份請願書，要求他利用他的影響力在巴勒斯坦建立一個猶太國家，這份請願書由約翰-洛克菲勒、J. P摩根和整個美國機構都支持這個想法，我自己，你知道幾千年的迫害和20世紀的恐怖，如果地球上有任何民族需要一個國家，併爲此值得一個國家，那肯定是果汁，同時你知道巴勒斯坦人是一個民族，他們成爲一個民族的部分原因是與以色列和猶太復國主義者的鬥爭，他們是人，人有權利，作爲一個美國人，我相信權利和權利，如自我決定。 所以我的希望仍然是，儘管這很困難，也很複雜，但有一天我能夠自由地從猶太國家旅行到巴勒斯坦國家，在這兩個地方都有朋友，這是我希望看到的，現在在書中我沒有提出建議，你知道我認爲現在很難實現，但這是我認爲大多數美國人希望看到的，也是我希望看到的。你在書中引用了馬克-吐溫的話，讓我看看能不能在這裏找到，是的，這裏引用了馬克-吐溫的話，我和內塔尼亞胡談話時，他提出的一個說法是，在猶太復國主義運動之前，巴勒斯坦領土，也就是現在的以色列是非常荒涼和被遺棄的，嗯，巴勒斯坦觀察員對這種描述非常不滿，覺得把猶太復國主義者描繪成前 現在，猶太復國主義者把前巴勒斯坦描繪成一個荒涼和被遺棄的荒地，但你引用了......讓我讀一下這個......美國化的土地，《聖經》中著名的流淌着牛奶和蜂蜜的土地在19世紀出現了骨幹和荒蕪，它的少數居民阿拉伯人和猶太人似乎非常悲慘，在貧困中祈禱疾病。欄目中寫道，從亞伯拉罕時代到現在，巴勒斯坦的居民只有無知的、墮落的、懶惰的、沒穿衣服的流浪漢和野蠻人，對吐溫和許多美國人來說，這塊聖地被現在的居民浪費了，他們糟糕的管理使所羅門王和大衛王的土地變成了吐溫所說的最無望的、沉悶的、心碎的一塊領土，而不是亞利桑那。在我的理解中，以色列的合法性主張之一當然是認爲這是一塊被上帝遺棄的領土，奧斯曼人自己也沒有興趣守住它，它沒有被特別有效地利用，而這個高級企業的後果之一是，曾經是 荒蕪的沙漠荒地變成了一個人口衆多、生產力強、經濟繁榮的國家 我對這一觀點有些同情，但這也讓我們清楚地看到，在與巴勒斯坦人的關係中，這個故事的問題元素。 如果你要爲巴勒斯坦人和以色列人辯護，你會如何根據這些對前猶太復國主義巴勒斯坦的描述來描述它呢？ 在19世紀，他們是奧斯曼帝國的一部分，有500年或400年的歷史，所以他們在伊斯坦布爾被土耳其人統治，你知道他們把阿拉伯人看作是一頭可以擠奶的牛，而不是他們是奧斯曼帝國主義的受害者，在英國人到來之前，你知道，我認爲人們會提出這樣的論點，我會更深入一點，說很多嗯，你知道重建和開花的巴勒斯坦 巴勒斯坦的繁榮是由於現代農藝和灌溉技術的出現，從某種意義上說，在19世紀沒有人知道這些技術，你知道以色列人真的帶來了，我是說全世界的人都在使用他們的旱作技術和灌溉技術，以及一些脫鹽和其他的東西，所以他們真的帶來了一些東西，但是把21世紀的以色列和19世紀的巴勒斯坦相比，你知道，這是一個有點 是的，所以這種比較有很多問題 科技的進步是其中之一 所以我們在討論有多少人居住在現在的以色列... ...在19世紀末，你知道嗎？所以你沒有每10年一次的十年一次的人口普查，沒有一個有組織的現代局的官僚機構來計算數字，所以你知道你如何估計人口，你知道你的依據是什麼，當你有像以色列巴勒斯坦這樣一個政治上有爭議的問題，每個人都有一個觀點，每個人都有一個議程，甚至沒有欺騙，你可以找到各種方法來獲得1890年的不同人口估計。
如果你明白我的意思，那麼是的，我真的不認爲，你知道在所有這些問題中，我在《約櫃》一書中試圖明確的一點是，在許多方面，以色列人和巴勒斯坦人之間的爭端是一百個這樣的爭端中的一個，你知道前南斯拉夫的克羅地亞人和塞爾維亞人，匈牙利人和特蘭西瓦尼亞的羅馬尼亞人。在所有這些爭端中，你會發現這些學者、歷史學家和思想家們，他們根據歷史提出了各種主張。 對，對，對美國人來說這不是很有說服力的論點，但是，無論如何，每個人都帶着這些事實的大軍，他們只是互相扔給對方，我們不可能通過篩選這些事實來獲得解決方案。如果你的丈夫和妻子吵架了，把婚姻中的每一次爭吵都翻出來，這實際上不是讓他們前進的方法，不不不，你需要你需要一些類似於團結的願景，不，我認爲這是一個非常好的觀點，我的意思是，到處都有衝突的原因之一 因爲事實本身是可以質疑的 我是說這幾乎是戰爭的先決條件的定義 我們根本不同意當地的現實情況，我們強烈反對，我們甚至不能討論它們，我們不得不 現在我們互相殘殺，我們不同意規則，你知道的，比如說什麼東西應該被裁決，你知道的，所以猶太復國主義者會說，他們有權說，所以國際聯盟承認英國對巴勒斯坦的授權是猶太人的民族家園，所以這是合法的。 巴勒斯坦人可能會說，英國人是殖民主義者，他們從奧斯曼帝國那裏偷走了土地，巴勒斯坦人從來沒有發言權，是什麼讓國際聯盟有權說英國人對這塊領土有權利，那是帝國的權利，是的，你和他們都是論點，人們支持他們有不同的理由，還有印度，還有邏輯上的理由，這兩件事很有技巧。在這本《約櫃》中，第一件事是，我想說的是，你提出了這個了不起的案例，你在前面提到過，猶太復國主義運動的巨大推動力並不是專門針對猶太人的，而是碰巧與基督教的福音流相吻合，這可能是正確的思考方式，即把在中東出現一個猶太國家視爲聖經預言傳統實現的一部分，你指出，正如你對洛克菲勒家族和JP摩根所作的那樣，在基督教方面有猶太復國主義運動 因此，我發現你的書中有一點很有說服力，那就是詳細介紹了猶太復國主義計劃在西方基督教國家得到的顯著而奇怪的支持，因此你還指出，如果由全世界的猶太人來決定，讓他們對以色列的政策進行民主投票，那麼很明顯，以色列方面的鷹派會是最受歡迎的，呃，可以說是提出了最受歡迎的觀點。與猶太人自己的信仰有關，沒有任何證據表明，你稱之爲火神星球理論，類似於整個猶太復國主義計劃是帝國主義猶太人的陰謀後果，然後你還提出了一個平行的案例，我也非常欣賞，所以首先設計這個故事比猶太人試圖偷走中東要複雜得多，這是肯定的，但也有一個意識形態問題，即在激進的左翼，特別是發展了這種反 殖民主義敘事的部分依據是，每一種人類關係都是以權力和剝削爲前提的，然後似乎發生的情況是，這種敘事可以說明西方人的殖民活動，儘管奇怪的是，在關於奧斯曼帝國的說法中沒有這種敘事。這對只有一種歷史觀念的人來說是很方便的，但在我看來，這並不符合以色列國的歷史進程，如果我們再看一下，你知道，人們聽到所有這些人都在談論以色列是歐洲在中東的殖民冒險，可以說是白人對棕色國家的佔領。當然，赫茲爾和他的猶太復國主義運動在歐洲猶太人中是很強大的，但今天以色列的大多數人，也就是最大的羣體不是歐洲人，而是中東猶太人，他們中的許多人實際上是被趕出他們在阿拉伯世界的家園，以報復發生在巴勒斯坦人身上的事情，儘管這些猶太人在伊拉克生活了幾千年，他們的祖先在埃及等等，與猶太復國主義運動或巴勒斯坦戰爭都沒有關係。他們作爲難民被趕出家園，來到以色列，這些人在討論中被忽略了，從阿拉伯世界來的猶太難民或多或少都有，人們顯然對所有這些數字有爭議，我不是這裏所有事情的偉大仲裁者，但與逃離或被趕出以色列的巴勒斯坦人數量相當 在那場戰爭中，這些猶太人是支持者，他們是內塔尼亞胡總理的核心支持者，不是歐洲猶太人，而是中東猶太人和俄羅斯猶太人，他們有不同的故事，但這些猶太人對巴勒斯坦人沒有負罪感，他是難民，我是難民，但全球對我的同情在哪裏？猶太難民會說，聯合國在哪裏爲我的孩子提供教育和免費醫療，我得到過什麼？ 我被稱爲殖民者，對嗎？他們回來看看他們的祖先在哪裏，我說這次旅行怎麼樣，他們說不太好，我說什麼意思，我說我們去參觀了華沙猶太區的紀念館，你知道猶太人對納粹的抵抗，在那裏形成了一羣人，他們大喊猶太人回家，哦，我的上帝，但是你知道他們去了巴勒斯坦，這是Ju，你知道他們回到了以色列。人們會說，猶太人回波蘭的家吧，猶太人回巴勒斯坦的家吧，人們必須有一個家，這絕對是......你會怎麼說呢，把逃離歐洲迫害進入以色列的猶太人視爲歐洲殖民者，這近乎惡毒。 但把逃離納粹德國或波蘭的歐洲猶太人視爲歐洲殖民者，我的意思是，耶穌同時談到了兩個方向，你知道這也是事實，這也是《約櫃》中我瞭解最多、最驚訝的事情之一。事實證明，斯大林與猶太人在獨立戰爭中的勝利和巴勒斯坦的納克巴流亡有很大關係，而不是英國人或美國人 英國人實際上在以色列獨立戰爭中站在阿拉伯人一邊，他們武裝了阿拉伯人，最成功的阿拉伯部隊是英國軍團，由英國人訓練的英國人領導。 訓練有素的英國軍團 在約旦軍隊中裝備的士兵 你知道，他們是西岸被阿拉伯人佔領的原因，直到1967年的戰爭 另一方面，美國人雖然對以色列人說了很多好話，但卻實施了武器禁運，這意味着絕望的以色列人在戰爭的大部分時間裏都在失敗，他們被圍困在耶路撒冷 他們無法從美國購買武器 忘記美國對以色列的援助 他們甚至無法用現金購買 我們實施了武器禁運 斯大林最後通過捷克斯洛伐克出售武器 捷克的武器工廠 捷克斯洛伐克的斯柯達武器工廠一直在爲佛蒙特州製造武器 斯大林允許捷克政府把這些武器賣給猶太人 這些納粹的多餘武器被偷運到英國控制的巴勒斯坦 正是這些武器讓猶太人在戰爭中扭轉了局勢 所以你知道，把這稱爲西方殖民主義的行爲 斯大林之所以這麼做，是因爲他正確地認爲，在巴勒斯坦出現一個猶太復國主義國家，會擾亂英國與阿拉伯人的關係，從而極大地削弱英國的力量和大英帝國在中東的力量，他還正確地認爲，這將有助於在美國和英國之間製造障礙。 所以整個故事，你知道，在人們的心目中，這是西方強加給他們的大帝國主義資本主義殖民計劃，這與歷史記錄不符，當然，在那些日子裏，以色列是一個左翼的事業，是的，美國的民主社會主義者，現在是非常反感以色列的，在20世紀50年代，以色列是社會主義的證明，對嗎？
證明了社會主義是有效的 以色列的政策是你所看到的 對卡博特人的頌揚 是的，沒錯，以色列實行計劃經濟 工會也非常強大 所以當人們說在社會主義下沒有自由時 美國的民主社會主義者說沒有 以色列表明你錯了 你是否認爲左派改變了立場的部分原因 比方說在與以色列的關係上 因爲內塔尼亞胡與很多社會主義傾向開戰，重新點燃了以色列的經濟，使其更接近於自由市場的資本主義國家 是的，這是幾個因素的結合，在70年代，以色列從社會主義的典型代表變成了 這也是70年代以色列從社會主義的典型代表變成了撒切爾主義和里根主義的典型代表 他們開始進行經濟改革，特別是創造了極具活力的科技行業 現在以色列的盟友遍佈全球，稍後將談到亞伯拉罕協議，因爲這顯然是一個重要因素。內塔尼亞胡的說法是這些 好吧 當我和他談話的時候他有兩個說法 不僅僅是我和他談話的時候 但一個是他非常努力地使以色列成爲一個強大的軍事力量 同時也非常努力地使以色列成爲一個強大的資本主義企業 而正是這兩件事的結合 誘使或迫使那些簽署了亞伯拉罕協議的阿拉伯國家同意，他們希望以色列成爲反對伊朗的盟友，因此，以色列在軍事上是強大的，它在這方面顯示了它的實力，但也因爲以色列的經濟已經擺脫了白癡的中央計劃社會主義的束縛，它已經成爲一個工業和技術強國，可以與之媲美。它已經成爲一個工業和技術強國 也許現在只有硅谷可以與之匹敵 這也使得以色列作爲貿易伙伴對阿拉伯國家很有吸引力 這些國家對經濟現代化很感興趣 這就是內塔尼亞胡的宣傳 你怎麼看? 我認爲從根本上說這是正確的 以色列得益於其經濟改革 但也得益於一些聰明的國家 這並不公平 但你知道國家一直在大力促進其科技部門的發展 但這基本上是在資本主義原則下進行的 而且效果很好 在這一點上 科技投資有助於 在過去，當你把錢花在國防上時，會削弱你的民用經濟，而不是建造一輛校車，你會建造一輛坦克，但今天越來越多，因爲很多國防能力都與I。 我認爲，這種變化正在推動世界朝着更多的武裝競賽的危險方向發展，這是一個真正有信心的事情，它正在推動世界走向更多的僞法西斯主義。 法西斯主義在國家最高層的大型企業之間的勾結，你知道這很好，希望這將是21世紀的考驗之一，很明顯，信息和國家權力是非常緊密結合的，在某些方面，信息正在成爲權力的貨幣，所以你當然，如果你是美國，你不希望Tick Tock或華爲能夠獲得關於你的人口的所有數據，當然反過來，如果你是美國，你不希望Tick Tock或華爲能夠獲得所有數據。當然，反之亦然，如果你是中國，那麼我們在20世紀90年代的一個幻想是，科技革命將使國家邊界消失，並創造一個單一的全球公共資源，但在我看來，現在的情況並非如此，科技革命實際上可能會重新創造出一些街區和強大的國家實體。是的，你在人工智能系統中也看到了這一點，因爲人工智能系統要正確地處理關於世界的信息，它必須有一個非常有區別的分佈式計算層次，不能只是一個集中的，你會說算法系統在一些算法原則的基礎上運行，然後是無區別的大規模活動。治理的適當模式必須是類似於我認爲類似於天主教的輔助性原則的東西，在這種模式下，你在等級制度的各個階層都有固有的主權，而且這種等級制度是相當深入、密集和有區別的，所以全球主義觀點的問題在於，有這樣一種觀念，即你可以有一個中央集權的小集團，可以做出相對簡單的中央決定，所有應該分配的權力 在所有這些附屬組織中，所有的權力都可以分配給中央當局，這是不可能的，所以會有一個像主權民族國家這樣的地方，因爲你希望治理儘可能在當地運作，所以你需要國家，你需要國家，你需要省，你需要鎮，你需要市，你需要家庭，這些組織的每一個層次都必須被賦予他們應有的政治和經濟權力。在政治和經濟權力方面 是的，我有大量的信息是無法消除的 所以這就是全球主義觀點的問題 據我所知，你對亞伯拉罕協議有什麼看法？ 我認爲從廣義上講，我認爲在某些方面 你講的故事是正確的，我想補充的是 阿拉伯人和以色列人都在關注伊朗 順便說一句，他們可能會關注土耳其 因爲奧斯曼帝國統治巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯世界長達數百年之久 隨着埃爾多安試圖恢復伊斯蘭土耳其的想法 他讓很多鄰國都感到非常緊張 他們都不希望任何國家能夠主宰中東，因爲如果任何國家這樣做，就會直接威脅到阿拉伯國家和以色列的獨立 他們過去沒有認識到這一點，因爲許多阿拉伯人都有這樣的夢想，希望有一個阿拉伯國家能夠主宰中東 那是薩達姆-侯賽因的夢想，是納薩爾的夢想，以他古怪的方式，是卡扎菲的夢想。 但這種泛阿拉伯或在某些情況下泛 但這種泛阿拉伯或泛伊斯蘭主義的中東願景，阿拉伯人總體上已經失去了信心，所以大家都明白，他們的利益和以色列的利益是以這種地緣政治的方式聯繫在一起的，但同時，你也有能源轉型的問題，特別是海灣阿拉伯人曾經想 現在他們不確定了 你知道100年後我們是否還在使用石油驅動的經濟？我是說我有點懷疑所有這些事情是否會發生 是的，它們不是好事，絕對不會發生 我是說拜登政府自己預測，要到2240年才能實現100％的可再生能源依賴性 對，所以這些關於我們要在2050年實現的想法不僅是荒謬的，而且是徹頭徹尾的謊言 但即使如此，阿拉伯人也必須考慮到 因爲另一方面，他們已經有了壓裂技術，他們有了來自其他資源的更大競爭 阿拉伯人必須考慮到石油的價格 他們從石油中獲得的收入長期來看會比他們曾經認爲的少幾萬億美元 所以這意味着在沙特阿拉伯這樣一個人口不斷增長的國家，政府爲了保持權力，需要以某種方式讓人民滿意，你必須考慮經濟增長，這意味着你需要技術，意味着你需要投資，意味着你需要有足夠的資金。這意味着你需要技術，你需要投資，你需要與擅長此道的人建立良好的關係 所以這也有一個經濟層面的問題，這是一個新的問題，現在被加入到戰略中來了 第三件事，我想一些參與亞伯拉罕協議的美國人並沒有過多地談論這個問題 但這是真實的 阿拉伯人和以色列人都不像以前那樣信任美國人 這部分是由於伊朗核協議這樣的事情 他們認爲是爲了美國的利益而犧牲自己的利益 但這也是我們在2001年選舉布什後 然後我們180度轉身，選了奧巴馬，八年後我們轉身，選了特朗普，四年後我們又選了拜登，所以那些美國在他們的安全中扮演重要角色的國家的人們，不得不比以前更努力地思考，我們不知道美國人在2024年要選誰。會不會是伊麗莎白-沃倫，會不會又是唐納德-特朗普，你知道他們不知道我們會做什麼，坦率地說我們也不知道，所以嗯，這意味着他們必須更加合作，所以美國的弱點實際上有助於推動亞伯拉罕協議，所以我對拜登政府的失望之一是我看到他們出於意識形態的動機 在我看來，如果拜登政府以一種態度去找沙特，那麼不幸的是，特朗普也可以爲《亞伯拉罕協議》爭得一些榮譽。
如果拜登政府張開雙臂去找沙特人，從某種意義上說，他們可能會成爲亞伯拉罕協議的下一個簽署方，而在我看來，拜登政府讓一個極其狹隘的 在我看來，拜登政府讓對特朗普和中東局勢的極端狹隘的意識形態觀點破壞了一個令人難以置信的機會，不僅是在和平方面，我的意思是美國人也非常想得到一些額外的沙特石油，但他們似乎失敗了，然後不得不轉向你知道可愛的委內瑞拉等政權。你認爲拜登政府和沙特在亞伯拉罕協議中的關係是怎樣的？ 你知道這是一個非常有趣的故事，而且很複雜，但我會盡可能簡單地告訴你，民主黨基本上已經恨了沙特70年了 上一個真正喜歡沙特的民主黨人是富蘭克林-D-羅斯福，他在1944年訪問了沙特，但在50年代，民主黨人實際上普遍討厭沙特，因爲他們當時非常親 他們看到艾森豪威爾政府往往納薩爾，並普遍往往阿拉伯人 這就是你喜歡一羣邪惡的封建君主，而不是民主的以色列 因爲你想要石油，石油壟斷企業是你的朋友，所以 所以要成爲一個好的自由主義民主黨人 就要恨沙特人，恨艾森豪威爾喜歡他們 然後你來到歐佩克，你知道70年代，現在你有了石油卡特爾 我想我們一直在保護你不被蘇聯和你的敵人傷害，你卻背叛了我們，抬高了價格 在那個時候，美國的工人階級基本上都是民主黨人，石油的價格翻了三倍，而當時人們的汽車每加侖只有10英里，它破壞了人們的生活，是沙特人在做這件事，然後你再加上你知道的，然後911出現了 再加上沙特人是布什的朋友 布什家族與沙特王室有長期的聯繫 很明顯，他們是邪惡的，他們是邪惡的 那麼現在，在所有這些上面，石油和溫室氣體，沙特人正在破壞世界 破壞了世界，因爲他們把所有的石油泵入大氣層，任何與沙特人的良好關係都是向大石油屈膝，通過氣候變化破壞人類生活，我在誇大其詞，但你可以看到我的意思，對對對，你也看到沙特對瓦哈比的廣泛支持，他們是代表一個相當該死的限制性伊斯蘭教原教旨主義形式的毒品毆打，但在我看來，所以，好吧，這是一個完美的風暴，但它仍然在我看來，美國的選擇在 在我看來，儘管沙特人有很多罪過，但認爲他們不比伊朗人好的想法是一種政治瘋狂。我想我們還需要考慮一個因素 你知道最近有一個關於卡塔爾對歐洲議會影響的大丑聞 他們實際上逮捕了歐洲議會前副主席的副主席等等 他們近年來與沙特發生了巨大的衝突，他們與伊朗的關係也比較緩和，他們大量參與華盛頓的政策網絡，一個主要智囊團的負責人就因爲這種關係而陷入了大麻煩。 我不是說每個人都這樣做，但如果你觀察華盛頓的政治，你可以看到一些線索在向前推進，好吧，但對一個老鼠軟弱的理由是什麼？有核野心，是個危險的政權，所以你怎麼能對伊朗心慈手軟呢？ 好吧，我可以叫你喬丹或者彼得森先生嗎？ 你肯定做得很好，我和我的沃爾特已經過了兩個小時了，我認爲我們應該，但我認爲我們可以這樣做。 伊拉克戰爭是美國在21世紀犯下的最嚴重的錯誤 人們會這麼說 與伊朗的戰爭甚至比伊拉克戰爭更糟糕 與伊朗開戰很容易，但一旦開戰，它就會吸人眼球 它會把我們從中國引開，中東就會變成一團火 等等，所以你的數字，此外，我們得離開中東，考慮中國 好吧，最大的危險是什麼？陷入中東戰爭的最簡單的方法是與伊朗對抗，因此你不能與伊朗對抗，這是我認爲很多人的想法，我認爲你知道，他們會說，現在我是你知道的，我不能告訴你這是他們的想法，因爲他們不能讀懂他們的思想，但我認爲這個立場的邏輯是我們必須說我們不想要伊朗的核武器，但實際上如果你在與伊朗的戰爭和美國之間做一個二元選擇。 如果給你一個二選一的選擇，即美國與伊朗開戰以防止其沒有核武器，或者只是希望如果他們獲得核武器，我們可以威懾他們，以色列也可以威懾他們，就像其他擁有核武器的國家被威懾一樣，他們會說與其打仗，不如讓他們擁有炸彈，我認爲這就是立場的邏輯，伊朗人嗅到了這一立場的邏輯，在談判中採取了非常強硬的態度，在這一點上，我們的代表繼續對拜登政府施壓，我認爲這可能就是發生的情況。我們談到了中國 談到了俄羅斯 談到了伊朗 談到了亞伯拉罕協議 談到了以色列和巴勒斯坦的複雜局勢 所以我們已經談了很多我希望談的內容 還有什麼是你想讓大家注意的？好吧，你知道... ...這是個很好的對話，我真的很喜歡... ...我們談到了很多事情... ...我想最後我想給大家一點樂觀的理由... ...因爲你知道世界形勢很嚴峻，有真正的戰爭危險... ...但是這個英美300年的系統... 但這個有300年歷史的商業資本主義全球自由框架體系並不是偶然存在的，我們所知道的世界秩序是有堅實的理由的，我們知道它有可能持續多久，但它們是支撐它的力量，其中之一，我們已經談到了這一點，一個具有資本主義原則的多元化社會實際上具有難以置信的創造力和活力，並不斷提出新的技術，新的經濟生產力，新的想法，新的制度，使其能夠不斷調整以適應不斷變化的條件，這使它具有巨大的優勢 與那些試圖遵循其他制度或其他方法的人相比 另一個優勢是地緣政治 美國是一個海上強國 你知道，我們不是在嘗試，我們沒有 我們沒有興趣征服法國，儘管法國有一些非常好的地方，我們 你知道，我們沒有 你知道，我們在二戰後佔領了日本 我們在二戰後佔領了日本，但我們退出了，我們不想留下，你知道，所以，但相反，像蘇聯這樣的陸地大國一直在擴張，他們想以一種海洋大國無法做到的方式支配他們的鄰國，所以當一個像俄羅斯、伊朗或中國這樣的國家開始威脅其鄰國時 他們都想成爲我們的盟友，所以隨着中國的威脅越來越大，我們可以看到日本突然將他們的國防預算增加了一倍，他們加深了與澳大利亞和印度的關係，你知道他們真的非常努力地建立聯盟，印度人也覺醒了，變得非常活躍。所以亞伯拉罕協議在中東出現了 民意調查和波羅的海地區的承諾 你知道瑞典和芬蘭想加入北約 所以當這個體系受到野心勃勃的大國的威脅時 其他大國就會組織聯盟 這不是什麼新鮮事，英國就是這樣 英國就是這樣在16世紀和17世紀初打敗了路易十四 英國就是這樣打敗了拿破崙 在第一次世界大戰中打敗了德皇威廉 在第二次世界大戰中打敗了希特勒和東條英機 這就是打敗蘇聯的原因 我們需要勇氣和遠見，也許甚至需要一點歷史知識，以幫助我們理解和評估我們正在經歷的世界歷史上這些令人難以置信的威脅和戲劇性的趨勢 我想這是以這種樂觀的方式來結束這篇文章 是的，我確實認爲這個冗長的英美作品所依據的原則 是的，我確實認爲英國和美國的生產力所依據的原則是堅如磐石的，特別是與所有已知的替代方案相比，對我們西方人來說，觀察到這一點並從中得到啓發是有益的，同時也要明白，這些基本原則在世界範圍內的傳播程度，以及它們的後果主要是產生了無與倫比的生產力和豐富的和平。因此，我們可以擁有更多這樣的東西，我也認爲這是我們可以掌握的，所以這是對2023年的一個很好的樂觀預測，希望平靜、穩定和明智的頭腦會佔上風，非常感謝你們今天與我交談，感謝所有在YouTube上觀看或在相關播客平臺上收聽的人，感謝你們的時間 我現在要把注意力轉移到半小時後的Daily wire plus平臺上，我將與沃爾特-拉塞爾-米德先生談論他的傳記進展，我對描述成功人士的生活細節非常感興趣。這就是我們要做的事情，感謝Daily Wire plus的人促成了這次談話，呃，祝所有正在觀看和收聽的人新年快樂，再次感謝沃爾特今天的談話，大家好，我鼓勵你們繼續收聽我與嘉賓在Dailywireplus的談話。 節目
