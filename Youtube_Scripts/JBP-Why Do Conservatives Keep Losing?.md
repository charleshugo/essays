conservatives keep losing the left controls media universities and government how can conservatives be effective and how can they win they have tell a better story fundamentally that's it or and then I think not only do they have to tell a better story they have to act out a better story that's the same with religious Believers it's like you want your God to win it's like get your act together right you'd be a shining light on the hill for your faith and then that's how you win you know and we shouldn't even be thinking about winning in some real sense we should be thinking about how to make things better and so the conservative question is how how could we be more effective at making things better than those who don't buy abide by the traditions we regard as valuable and that's the real question it's it's very very difficult to sort that out one of the things I didn't know that I was a conservative before everybody started telling me that I was but but um apparently I am so and uh one of the one of the benefits of that is that there are conservative stories that are quite compelling and and they haven't been told well for quite a long time and one of the maybe the core story that's compelling on the conservative side is something like that meaning and responsibility are integrally linked and that's not a story that's been well told in our culture for at least at least since the mid 60s it's just not told at all and I've noticed that that story has a universal impact on the audiences that I've been addressing to to walk people through the notion for example that if you find yourself in Dire Straits at some point in your life that one of the arcs that you might have managed to build yourself will be constructed of the social relations made possible by the people for whom you took responsibility and everyone understands that as soon as you lay it out it's like well of course that's going to be the case obviously right if you have been a credit if you have conducted yourself credibly in the eyes of the people you've interacted with the probability that they're going to be hungry for the opportunity to reciprocate is very very high and so one core conservative message is something like meaning through responsibility and that's a very very deep message I mean that's that's the idea of burying your cross it's the same idea it's that the deeper the responsibility the more radical the meaning radical in terms of its capacity to transform and sustain and I think that's just that's just true it's sort of it's as soon as you think it through you understand it's true and it's quite the it's quite the crazy idea though that your life would deepen and broaden in precise proportion to the degree that you were willing to take radical responsibility and that's something you can experiment with and that's something that's a message conservatives should and could and should deliver but also more importantly act out right that's the fundamental issue is the acting out and uh I think that young people are they're literally dying for that message because we are in a meaning crisis in some real sense cataclysmic consequence of the death of god let's say what should Orient you in life it's well certainly the the willingness to dare to accept radical responsibility that's a good that's a good answer to the question of how do you find meaning in life you can try just doing the best you possibly can for other people and I don't mean in a sense of bitter self immolation you know that's just not that's not going to sustain itself it's not a good strategy but you could just try that and see what happens it's like and you kind of know what's going to happen because there'll be people who take advantage of you but they even might learn with time anyone capable of Shame is certainly going to be shamed by the realization that they've betrayed someone who's been good to them insofar as there have any capacity for shame whatsoever even the worst of people can find a pathway to Redemption through that kind of shame but that won't even emerge unless there's been someone who is good to them that they that they could betray now and one of the things that struck me from reading Carl Jung again the psych Swiss psychoanalyst who was a stunning genius he believed that it was very obsessed with what had happened in Germany and in the 1930s and the 1940s and and then also with the emergence of the potential for nuclear Annihilation after the second World War and his hypothesis was something like we have to become as good as we are technologically powerful and right now we're more technologically powerful than we are good and he believed that was in part because our technological Enterprise had expanded in some sense exponentially since the since the dawn of the Scientific Revolution but that our ethical wisdom had stagnated or well stagnated is good enough and now it's not acceptable because as you you become more powerful you better become better because otherwise that power will your foolishness will you'll be unable to control the power that you've developed and it will turn against you as a consequence of your own sin that's a perfectly good way of thinking about it and so that struck me as highly credible especially after I'd read a lot about totalitarian States and the fact that the reason totalitarian states can maintain themselves so that would be definitely the use of power against our own power against ourselves a totalitarian state the reason those States sustain themselves is because every individual in those States lies about everything all the time so it's a direct consequence of individual sin now that's not all it is but it that's that's a lot of what it is that's for sure and so I felt that the pathway forward into the a world of unlimited human technological ability was through the radical renovation of the individual psyche as radical renovation as the technological renovation itself and we're playing that out now we're we're going to find out probably in the course of most of our lifetimes whether or not we can manage that and we're pretty technologically powerful and we're getting more technologically powerful all the time and very very quickly and so that means we better get better fast at the same time and uh yeah and on the hardening thing I would say the hardening thing in that is that you know that's not a matter of just constraining yourself because people think well you know how dull it is to be good there's all these things that I would like to do that I no longer can it's all constraint in walls it's all regulations and rules and conservatives can come across as people who promote that viewpoint it's all about constraint but that's not right because there isn't anything more adventurous than being good and there isn't anything better than Adventure and you might say well why is being good an adventure and one of the answers to that is well it's really difficult and so that's a plus it's difficult in a voluntary sort of way it means you have to take yourself in hand right and that's that's a challenge but maybe you want a challenge it seems that you want a challenge and you might say for you might observe that part of being good is saying what you believe to be true and you might say well why is that an adventure and the answer is well you don't know what's going to happen if you tell the truth right whatever happens when you tell the truth is whatever's going to happen when you tell the truth you have to let go of the outcome you have to it's an Act of Faith you have to presume if you're going to tell the truth this is a very strange thing if you're going to tell the truth you have to presume axiomatically that whatever happens when you tell the truth is the best thing that could have possibly happened sort of regardless of what happens and because sometimes you get in trouble for telling the truth in fact that's why children lie right almost always they lie because they don't want to get in trouble and then you might say to them well they might object well why shouldn't I lie because I just get in trouble if I told the truth it's like well the answer is because you'll get a lot more trouble if you lie it'll just take a lot longer to manifest itself but when it does it'll be way worse and so you might as well take your lumps well well the hand that's delivering the blow is still relatively mild rather than store it up and wait for the crushing blow that will definitely come for you if you stack up enough lies and so you tell the truth because you presume that whatever manifests itself as a consequence of the truth is the habitable order that is good that's also a an axiom of the belief in the logos is that truth sets you free and the alternative to believing that is to believe that falsehood sets you free it's like fine you know try it out well and what you see what we saw in the 20th century is that if falsehood rules then you have a totalitarian state that's the definition of a totalitarian state everyone lies about everything to everyone all the time and that's hell and you might say well I don't believe in hell it's like well have it your way visit North Korea and see if it's real it's real enough and you might say well it's not Eternal it's like well you feel like it was if you lived there so and I'm not so sure it's not Eternal in some in some more fundamental sense as well because it's always a place we could go and so and it's always there as a possibility so and I don't know what that means in the final analysis but I know what it means practically and politically you know in a tangible sense so

保守派一直在失敗 左派控制了媒體 大學和政府 保守派如何纔能有效，如何才能獲勝 他們必須從根本上講講一個更好的故事 就是這樣，然後我認爲他們不僅要講一個更好的故事 他們還要表演一個更好的故事，這就是 宗教信仰者也是如此，你希望你的上帝獲勝，就像你的行爲是正確的，你會成爲你的信仰在山上閃耀的光芒，然後這就是你獲勝的方式，你知道，我們甚至不應該考慮在某種真正意義上獲勝，我們應該考慮如何使事情變得更好。所以保守派的問題是，我們如何能比那些不買賬的人更有效地使事情變得更好，我們認爲這纔是真正的問題，這是非常非常困難的事情，我不知道我是一個 在每個人開始告訴我我是保守派之前，但顯然我是這樣的，呃，其中一個好處是，有保守派的故事是相當有說服力的，而且他們已經很久沒有被講好了，其中一個也許是核心的故事，就是 我注意到，這個故事對我所講的聽衆有普遍的影響，讓人們瞭解這個概念，例如，如果你在生命中的某個時刻發現自己在Dire Straits，你可能設法建立的一個弧線將是由你所負責的人構建的社會關係。每個人都明白，只要你把它說出來，就會覺得當然會是這樣的，顯然是這樣的，如果你是一個有信用的人，如果你在與你交往的人眼中表現得很可信，那麼他們就有可能渴望得到回報。所以保守派的一個核心信息是通過責任來實現意義，這是一個非常非常深刻的信息，我的意思是，這就是埋葬你的十字架的想法，這是同樣的想法，責任越深，越激進 就其轉變和維持的能力而言，其含義是激進的，我認爲這就是真實的，只要你想清楚，你就會明白這是真的，這是很瘋狂的想法，雖然你的生活會加深和擴大，與你願意的程度成正比 你的生活會變得更深更廣，與你願意承擔激進的責任成正比 這是你可以嘗試的事情，這也是保守派應該、可以、應該傳遞的信息 但更重要的是行動起來，這纔是根本問題，呃，我覺得 我認爲年輕人正在爲這個信息而死，因爲我們正處在一個意義上的危機中，在某種意義上是上帝之死的災難性後果，讓我們說說在生活中應該如何引導你，當然，願意敢於接受激進的責任，這是一個好的，是 一個很好的答案，你如何找到生活的意義，你可以嘗試爲其他人做最好的事情，我不是指痛苦的自我毀滅，你知道這不是一個好的策略，這不會持續下去，但你可以嘗試，看看會發生什麼。看看會發生什麼，你知道會發生什麼，因爲會有一些人利用你，但他們甚至可能隨着時間的推移而學會，任何有能力感到羞恥的人肯定會因爲意識到他們背叛了對他們好的人而感到羞恥，只要有任何羞恥的能力。只要他們有任何羞恥的能力，即使是最壞的人也能通過那種羞恥感找到一條通往救贖的道路，但那甚至不會出現，除非曾經有一個對他們好的人，他們現在可以背叛，而其中一件事讓我印象深刻，再次閱讀卡爾-榮格 榮格是瑞士精神分析學家，他是一個令人驚歎的天才，他認爲他對德國發生的事情非常着迷，在20世紀30年代和40年代，以及第二次世界大戰後出現的核毀滅的可能性，他的假設是，我們必須變得和我們的技術力量一樣好，而現在我們的技術力量比我們的善更強大，他認爲這部分是因爲自科學革命的黎明以來，我們的技術企業在某種意義上成倍增長，但 我們的道德智慧已經停滯不前了 或者說停滯不前已經很好了 而現在這是不可以接受的 因爲當你變得更強大的時候 你最好變得更好 因爲否則那股力量會 你的愚蠢會 你將無法控制你所開發的力量 它將作爲你自己罪惡的後果而反擊你 這是一個非常好的思考方式 極權主義國家之所以能維持下去，是因爲這些國家的每一個人都一直在撒謊，所以這是個人罪惡的直接後果，這不是全部，但這是它的大部分，這是肯定的。我們會發現，在我們一生中的大部分時間裏，我們是否能做到這一點，我們在技術上非常強大，而且我們在技術上一直在變得更加強大，而且非常迅速，所以這意味着我們最好同時變得更好。我想說的是，硬化的事情是，你知道這不是一個僅僅約束自己的問題，因爲人們認爲，你知道做好事是多麼無趣，有所有這些我想做的事情，我不再能做了，這都是牆壁上的約束，都是法規和規則。保守派可能會被認爲是提倡這種觀點的人，這都是約束，但這是不對的，因爲沒有什麼比做好事更冒險，沒有什麼比冒險更好，你可能會說，爲什麼做好事是一種冒險，其中一個答案就是 答案之一是，它真的很困難，所以這是一個優點，它的困難是一種自願的方式，這意味着你必須把自己掌握在手中，這是一個挑戰，但也許你想要一個挑戰，似乎你想要一個挑戰，你可能會說，你可能會觀察到，成爲好人的一部分是 你可能會說，爲什麼那是一種冒險，答案是，你不知道如果你說實話會發生什麼，對，當你說實話的時候會發生什麼，當你說實話的時候會發生什麼，你必須要放下結果。你必須這樣做，這是一種信仰的行爲，你必須假定，如果你要講真話，這是一件非常奇怪的事情，如果你要講真話，你必須公理地假定，無論你講真話時發生什麼，都是可能發生的最好的事情。因爲有時你會因爲說真話而惹上麻煩，事實上，這就是爲什麼孩子們會撒謊的原因，他們幾乎總是撒謊，因爲他們不想惹上麻煩，然後你可能會對他們說，他們可能會反對，爲什麼我不應該撒謊，因爲如果我說真話，我就會惹上麻煩。答案是，如果你撒謊，你會遇到更多的麻煩，只是需要更長的時間來表現出來，但當它表現出來時，情況會更糟糕，所以你不如把你的腫塊拿出來好了。所以你說了真話，因爲你認爲凡是因真話而表現出來的東西都是可居住的秩序，都是好的，這也是邏各斯信仰的一個公理，即真話使你自由。而相信這一點的另一個選擇是相信虛假能讓你自由 這就好比，你知道的，試一試，你會看到什麼 我們在20世紀看到的是，如果虛假占主導地位，那麼你就會有一個極權主義國家 這就是極權主義國家的定義 每個人都在對所有人撒謊 你可能會說，我不相信有地獄，這就像... ...用你的方式去訪問朝鮮，看看它是否真實，它足夠真實，你可能會說，它不是永恆的，就像... ...如果你住在那裏，你會覺得它是如此，我不確定它不是永恆的。我不太確定它不是永恆的，在某些更基本的意義上也是如此，因爲它總是一個我們可以去的地方，所以它總是作爲一種可能性存在，所以我不知道這在最終分析中意味着什麼，但我知道它在實際和政治上意味着什麼，你知道在一個具體的意義上，所以
