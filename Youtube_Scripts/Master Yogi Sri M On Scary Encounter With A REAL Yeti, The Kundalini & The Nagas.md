krishna and the gita says to arjuna i am the one who gives memories i'm also the one who wipes it out you know that wiping out happens to everybody actually everybody has this under every video we've ever created about yetis your name comes up is it yes why is that simply because i happen to mention that when i wanted to go to the to kailash somebody came in something came in i knew that it is a furry kind of person the first doubt was it was that it's a bear but no it was standing like a human being this he said they are good people they are not what people think and fear he brought a herbal medicine and stuffed it into your mouth otherwise you'd have died this one is not a conversation for the skeptics this is a conversation for the believers but in this conversation with sri m a renowned author and spiritual leader we did address skepticism and then went on to cover all of his life's experiences there's a few guests where i know that there's 20 podcasts within this person and shriyam is one of those this was just the first conversation with this man he spoke about everything from yetis to demons to beings from other realms to the meaning of spiritual growth in terms of human existence what's the purpose of spirituality what's the purpose of meditation and where do these other entities these sci-fi style entities even fit into the world of spiritualism this conversation will bend your mind and then open it up i highly recommend you try listening to the entire conversation and i also highly recommend that you follow us on spotify experience spotify exclusive which means that every episode is available on spotify 48 hours before it's available anywhere else in the world this is shreem appearing on the ranvi show for the first time beautiful conversation coming your way [Music] she am i'm overwhelmed that you're on the show today i honestly don't know where to begin this conversation with you and i'd love to see these conversations with you uh because there's that much to speak to you about all your i want to say life's experiences but i'm going to say souls experiences instead um but maybe to begin a series with you i'd love to just know about this lifetime sir firstly how are you today today i'm good but then i'm generally always like this you know in spite of whatever is happening i maintain a quiet mind and i'm very happy that you call me i know what you do the kind of work so the idea is as in the gita sarvatra samabuddha which means to remain tranquil under all circumstances so therefore through the question how are you i'm okay i'm fine [Laughter] wow i'm a little stumped that's my usual starter for all these episodes but uh let's let's begin with this lifetime what's your earliest memory from this life my earliest memory in this life in this physical body um till the age of nine i don't remember much except what everybody remembers normal but after i had the unique experience of my guru maheshwar not laying his hand on my head and saying somewhere after that i started having memories of before uh i have had memories like nobody has asked me this question before i've had memories of being enclosed in some dark room you know as a small little embryo powerless not able to move but in a memory is flooding inside of the past and then one day all of a sudden all their memories disappeared and i was out and then i have only memories of this life till i started dwelling deep into my layers of consciousness and tracing back why this thing has happened where did it start how come i'm in these circumstances this came much later because at some point you know the memories are cut off before you come out krishna in the gita says to arjuna i am the one who gives memories i'm also the one who wipes it out you know that wiping out happens to everybody actually everybody has these memories some discover it later some don't discover it in this life at all that's the only difference um i want to take you back to that meeting with your guru um i would love for you to describe it a little bit so because that's what's available about you online if someone has not read your books that one account is available and it's written about how that one account was kind of the beginning of your journey in this lifetime very true so i would also love to know a little bit about your guru and about the concept of a guru in general okay um i was when i was nine years old you know i was born in a immigrant muslim family from across the border into kerala my forefathers came as security uh personal security guards to the maharajas of travancore that's how we came here because then we got settled basically i would say i'm like keralite if you ask me although i traveled a lot in the north but i was born and brought up in trivandrum trivandrum is a tiruvananthapuram the city of ananta sayana vishnu lang padmanavasami so when i was young or the backyard of our house was very long very big and many of our friends who neighbors used to come and play by 6 6 30 they would have all gone home and i was alone this happened every day almost and then when i was about to go home i looked far into the end of the backyard i said i saw some very unusual person standing under the jackfruit tree that was a jackfruit tree the huge big jackfruit tree unique because i've now never seen such a person in my life i was startled because i don't know how that person came there later on i reasoned maybe he came jumped on the compound wall there was that part of the comfort knowledge little shot but i was taken by surprise because at that age at the age of nine he looked very he was tall afterwards i discovered but then he looked very tall and i've never seen a matted haired person in my life his hair was all matted up here and very fair very tall no upper garment except a small cloth here he carried a peculiar thing in his hand later on i came to know it's a commander and on his neck was a garland of huge big rudraksha which i didn't know at that time what a rudraksha is so when i saw that i was wondering who's this where is this guy come from now so he gets chair with his hand like this fine you know what is the natural reaction when the evening was about to get dark stranger calling you that was strange looking stranger the reaction is bold but i felt i must go so i went closer to him then i was standing with him faced not face to face because he was taller looking down so he asked me do you remember anything i said no because i didn't remember i didn't know what he was asking remember what he said no then he said he put his hand on my head he said it in hindi but i'm telling you in english he said when the time comes you will remember everything everything will be fine and then he said go back so i walked back still wondering what's happening here to me only thing i remember i carried with me was those big eyes of us and they were haunting me like for many years they were there i walked back i know that i reached the kitchen at the back and my mother was cooking something now i wanted to turn back and look i could not i could turn back only when i climbed the steps and went the back door then i turned back there was nobody there so i said but it was not a vision it was an accident thing anyway because i could still feel that hand on my head you know there's something the feeling of warmth and i tried to tell my mother i just couldn't talk i could say everything except this incident for many years it remained like that locked anyway i went inside had something to eat from that day started the whole change in my life the change in i had never learned to meditate before i started how do i how did i start when i went to sleep that night uh around midnight i felt that somebody was waking me up not as if there was anybody there completely awake in midnight and i felt it in the navel some kind of a warm feeling and the light like these things you use for deepavali the fireworks the round thing that rotates something here was moving and then it spread throughout the body and there was a feeling of blissfulness this was my first meditation and the first change that happened it and this happened every day every i'm sorry every night i wouldn't sit up because i thought if i sit up we all used to sleep in one big you know the olden days like join families and so i used to lie down and do it this went on i started understanding many things and then i got this desire to read about the open shirts and and i used to go to the libraries later on as i grew up and read whatever was available to me books came to me unasked for many times and then my meditation started deepening but the most interesting part was it so happened that situations would happen where i would meet spiritual persons from all over situations where situations would happen by which i would run into almost some people who are considered to be holy men yogis swamis in our area in trivandrum area and from them i got a lot of blessings and sometimes instructions and it went on till i reached the age of 19 i wrote my exams and then at the age of 19 i felt that i have to move what kind of instructions were they giving you sometimes the instructions were verbal sometimes the instructions were non-verbal verbal instruction there was one swami abeda nanda who used to live in the fourth area where the padmanava swami temple is not so well known but he had the following and i used to go there too on a saturday sunday walk up from our bicycle sometimes and he would make me sit near him and he knew that i was doing some kind of a practice which was to do with the kundalini and all that i have not instructed reading various things here and there he told me oh you don't have to do all this just bhakti is enough say the name of god you know things like that and he would insist that i had food with him and go these are some of the verbal instruction sometimes i would go and um for instance there was a man called gopala swami there gopala swami was called gopala pillai swami his name was he was actually a clerk in the accounts department in trivandrum but he was a very advanced yogi he was unmarried but he never wore any ropes whereas so when i was small at age of 12 i used to go to a nearby house to learn mathematics they're really weak in mathematics so somebody used to instruct me one mr ram swami one day i went they said oh today there is no class i said why what happened no swami has come so there is no see which swami has come what i did curious then his mother came out and said come come inside so i went there and i saw this man sitting well built man short haircut no sign of any swami nothing but his cloth was tied like this cross belt type and as soon as i entered he said malayalam come here sit down he put his hand on my head and massage and then he told them very good boy very good boy like that in my hand this has this non-verbal instructions you feel some information went into your mind my mind was changing i began to see um more than she feel that there were things much beyond what we normally think of that this world is not a three-dimensional world there are other things beyond and i also felt that my calling was to find the ultimate happiness in the ultimate infinite supreme rather than satisfy day-to-day things that we normally think of at that time uh so this started happening i have to ask you about the journey again we're back to age 19 um usually a teenage is like the beginning of adulthood where you actually begin to get your first few droplets of philosophy in your head and you start questioning life and purpose and these things right was that happening to you or had it happened a lot earlier and were you just you know already sure about no i was not sure okay i had some extraordinary experience which we discussed some time back meeting strange people so-called strange people they're not really strange and getting some information and some experiences and so on but it was at that age of 19 that i began to think seriously that i need to have a very tangible experience in these matters before i can begin to believe in them you wanted the experience i wanted i wanted to actually i read by then so many textbooks talking about moksha talking about the ultimate reality i had a few experiences which is just abc but then i i wanted to and i thought this environment where i'm staying is not going to help me i also deep down in my mind had a feeling that somewhere in the himalayas somebody's waiting for me to teach specifically the himalayas like you used to think about it yes some snow clad mountain i don't know whether him snow clad mountains where i'm walking and there's someone standing up there this kind of thoughts used to occur part of it may be my desire to go to find out and also i've read that great yogis live in them could be but this was their recurring all the time and i also felt that in this situation where i was at home since i was the only child i'm an only male child in india that's a big thing and supposed to take over your family's business and then i was getting kind of like feeling that i was in a cage i wanted to break out of that it was a golden cage okay many would have preferred to stay in the golden cage but i wanted to break it cage is a cage you write wood or gold so it was like a bird which can't fly one day i decided i'd just go you know understand those days there was no google there is no maps there is no nothing so i used to look for some time a railway guides and find out where to go to the himalayas where is rishikesh and one day finally i left i had some money with me and i've never traveled for such long distances on my own but i just went i had a lot of problems about trying to i had some money where to find food how to travel in trains it went on i mean and cold i didn't realize that i needed some warm clothes and so on i suffered a lot even after i reached rishikesh by train i suffered a lot so i thought let me stay in some ashram at least look after the body so i stayed in divine life society swami chigananda was the head of that society and that i met him i used to meet him talk to him but he also knew that i won't stay there he said you're going i don't think will stay here uh then one day i left and then i started walking so from rishikesh to badrinath i decided to go on foot by the time i reached vashishtagofa which is on the way quite close 20 kilometers away 25 my legs were all swollen and i just couldn't i so went to the cave there was a swamiji there he died about nine months ago he looked after me he said don't go anywhere stay he was also from kerala so there was a common language and so on he looked and then afterwards okay i didn't stay a single day i moved on so i walked i met a couple of people here and there some ashrams wow took me one month and ten days or something if i remember right did you have any crazy experiences on the way yeah i met a couple of swamis and instead of some yogis i also met some cannabis smoking guys who were not swami who looked like some all kinds of things happened to me i met wise people who were very simple i went i remember in the evening i i went into an ashram there was a vaishnavite sadhu the three marks everywhere i think there some i went and i always made it a point to tell them the truth who i was and what my name was where i came from you said very good saying that puja is over then you have food with me puja was over they went to the ganga dharati came back then after that he said come let's have a chat man he said good your intentions are good but i have to tell you something if you take sannyas renounce the world it takes seniors you have to be very careful because you have to be sure you're ready for it he said if somebody is climbing up steps to go to the top of the mountain if you fall from the first or second step you won't get hurt if you go up there and fall you will not be able to recover you'll break your limbs was that a way of saying if you fail your tests once you yeah okay yes so he kind of gave me some warning like be careful but what can go wrong on that journey of renouncing the world it can go wrong in the sense that we are not ready for it we don't know what we are going in for and then we find life too tough and either you succumb to the temptation and still wear a robe or you succumb to temptation and leave everything and come off back to the world i think the first thing i said is worse than coming back to the world that you that you wear the rope but you don't you can't live the life then it becomes a double life uh it's better to say okay i can't do this and get back so he was warning me in that kind of you know that sun ganesha in allende his father became a sannyasit while his wife was still young and so she had became pregnant and he ran off he went off to genny not his yogi and one day ganinath came to alandi and there is a tree there around which women are supposed to go around to free themselves of their troubles so he saw a young lady going around praying saying i'm pregnant please bring back the father he stopped and he blessed her and said tatars too then he asked her who is your husband she described found that he was his disciple he never told him that he met so he went and said go back this is not the way so he came back therefore the whole family was kind of thrown out of society because you you become a sannyasin then you throw away your robe and you come back but his guru wanted him to do it so he came back so they were ostracized and kept out hmm the story is that once the pundits were having a vedic discussion and something by the time all the children became great yogis including ganeshwar uh mukta bhai the sister also became a yogini um his brother became a urasinat another yogi so one day and ganesha was very small very young and he was walking he saw the people chanting the vedas so he also went to join coming from a family which knew the vedas they said this is the same fellow that sannyasin who came back you know he's asked he can't be allowed here go up you can't chant the vedas the story is that ganesha called a buffalo which was walking on the road and put his hand on the buffalo said in the buffalo chanted this is the story we don't know many things are you know me myths and realities sometimes mixed up but it's an example to show so like that i had i met several people met and then i went to rishik i reached where i met the rawalji first probably the priest of the bodhina temple since the time of adi shankara's time when he revived the badri temple he decided that the priest here has to be an ambudri from kerala there was vedic families who are selected they have a five-year tenure and they have the brito i went and met him i told him that i'm coming from such and such a place and i told him honestly who i was everything um i'm looking for a guru i think there is some yogis in the himalayas here in burke i got the most discouraging response to this he said you should go back because there's nobody like that here the ganja smoking zadoos go back and he also said that you're an educated fellow why are you wasting time here go back and do i said i listened to everything but i said can you find a place for me to stay for some time that he said i will do and he found a kutia for me across the other side of dal canada so i stayed there i used to go there for food prasad and i stayed every day after the puja they used to play cards so i was getting a little disillusioned i burnt my bridges and now here so there is a place uh the last village in indian village is mana on the border after that 30 kilometers you get the tibetan indo-tibetan border but the village last village is mana so i thought maybe i will go that way because i've heard that in vasundara falls and so on there are caves or yogis so i took a walk in the evening it was cold by the time i had blankets and sweaters then i passed the vyasa gopha there is a vyasa gufa there on the right side nobody was there i continued went to mana crossed went on and then it was just i went and looked and there were some caves on the rocks but there was nobody there and one of the cave had a door fixed and somebody had locked it and gone off i said okay let's go back i was coming it was getting dark that time i felt very suicidal because i thought that nothing seems to be working for me maybe it is because of this body maybe if i come back next time in a different situation different body it might work so i came to the edge of alakananda down mana and i contemplated on committing suicide actually i said let me end my maybe i'll come back with but then i was worried that i might suffer and i was just thinking the water rose with the big sound there just thinking how many minutes do you think i'll suffer will it and i was just thinking anyway i said let me meditate for a while and take a decision so i went back to the vyasa gopher i saw a fire outside so i said there must be somebody because when i went that side nobody was there i went inside and bhavajis my sonat bhavaji stood up the same guru yeah i know that eyes that eyes were with me all the time those big eyes and his first respond was oh so after wandering here and there you come back again to me so i told him i will not leave you ever and he said we'll think about it and laughed so i stayed with him three and a half years almost yeah almost like i stayed with him i wandered with him wherever he went i followed him i learned from him he taught me what could be taught in an university for maybe ten years in two years one year he carried no books even he thought open his openness came from his head when he taught the gita it came from his head so in those three years i would say it was kind of a crash course for me i would love for you to talk a little bit about the three years many things happen but the main thing was i started to discover that this man was not an ordinary man sometimes before i could think of something he would know what i was going to think because all the scriptures which i learned the vedic and the upanishads and yoga sutras and the gorak somehow the he was also an athbanti so the teachings of gaura knight koraksha sataka siddha siddhanta padari it was all there for him here he never carried a book and i learned from him and whatever i learned i never forgot i would assume that you all mainly focused on actually practicing some form of kriya yoga or yeah just not some form kriya yoga okay no babaji taught me all much of the different schools like in in indian tradition we have five darsanas now the senate means schools of philosophy but the word darsana means face to face so whatever school of philosophy ultimately it was to take you face to face with the truth that's what all the darsanas are about there is sankhya there is a uttara mamsa um vedanta and of course yoga these are all darsanas so i learned all of them bit by bit all the texts that were necessary to understand but why did you learn all of them because you said tomorrow you you will be given a teaching assignment and you should know everything because people who come to you will become different fields you will meet swamis yogis different scholars you need to know how what they are saying so i went through all this but my practice was kriya are you comfortable explaining what kriya is to the audience very much i can't give kriya in this kind of word but the word kriya in uh in the sastras in the yoga sastras simply means a practice these are all different but when we say when i say kriya i'm talking about that particular set of kriya teachings that has come to us from sri guru bhavaji not my master but his master that person ah now that is a picture i think drawn by yogananda brother based on yogananda swami's description so it was yogananda paramahamsa who first coined the word mahathar babaji because he said many avatars have come and gone but this person is there for a long long time he's supposed to be there till the end of the kaluga which we are only halfway to kalyukana this is your guru's guru yes so maheshwara so but we for thousand years he has been referred to before the yogananda swami's book came out as sri guru bhavaji used for him and when garakanath the great guraknath wrote his texts he always started with sri guru namaha then you will find the messiah which means the not who lives forever forever with this so in many traditions he's known as sri guru babaji and so when i talk about kriya it's that kriya that has come to us from that that lineage from but there may be other kriyas what was that his purpose purpose yes to bring back kriya yeah because you see it's a very step-by-step systematic methodical way of transcending the ordinary uh to make it simpler for listeners who've not heard of kriya yoga before it's supposed to be one of the fastest forms of spiritual advancement now that depends also on other factors if i say i live my life as i want and then if i do no that doesn't work you have to follow the yemenia mass rules and regulations and then practice and also it depends on how much you practice and how diligently you practice and how carefully you practice that is also there just because some carefully means making sure that you do it regularly making sure that you don't miss the points which are described to you it's a belief that you take kriya is of no use as the yoga sutras in a regular practice is necessary therefore things can open up so what kriya does is it's a basically it's a way of erasing your awareness from the grass to the subtle with attention to the spine which is called the sushumnandi what does growth to the subtle mean that means the mind is usually caught up in what we call prithvi which means the gross forms of energy physical and so on you have to raise the mind from that to subtler and subtler levels which means to take your awareness through different parts of your spine this final chord the sushumnandi which it's called then the mind becomes finer and finer and finer till it finally figures out the origin of this whole substance called the human so you've been practicing for a very long time now yes what is your reality now in the moment after so many years of practice for me now i practice because i enjoy it i don't practice it for anything else i enjoy practicing but what it has done to me is it has opened up many dimensions to my mind it has taken me from the mind can be at a given moment shifted from the lower to the higher highest levels that will at will of consciousness when you say higher levels do you mean closer to god no you know from the indian system of thought when the mind is free of all liberties that mind reflects divinity and divinity is not something that sits out there like the god concept in semitic religions it's the spark of the divine that exists in us this is god it's not some outside thing it's the entire universe which is pervaded by the supreme being but it is recognized in the human being as once the core of one's own consciousness in one's own being this is the jiva this is god it's not something outside do you believe in higher beings yes i do you believe in higher wings yes and i ask you this because the podcasting community talks about these things all over the world i'm not i don't believe in higher beings i know that higher beings exist what is the meaning of whatever belief means i don't know i believe for me it's not a belief higher beings there are many kinds first of all it is so funny to think that in this earth there are only human beings it's very limited way of thinking there are other beings we don't see them doesn't mean that they don't exist you don't see the air but it exists so there are now we are talking right we're talking about something serious and it is going to lead to so many people understanding certain things believe me there are these beings around encouraging hoping helping saying push let it go to the world you may not see it that doesn't mean that they don't exist then it is not necessary to see so you know in terms of an ant i don't know if an ant actually has the same kind of perception that we do as human beings but an ant certainly can't jump true moves only in like straight lines right i've often wondered even as a kid that what is the perception of that ant yes when we can move straight sideways so he doesn't understand suppose you jump and go from here to there the ant cannot make out that it's just it's a miracle for the hands because it knows only the linear directions so we are the higher being for the for the yeah in relation to not and let's say some other small creatures and therefore for the higher beings we in our undeveloped state are like the end okay it's difficult to conceive even what it is all about where would you even begin this conversation of higher beings would you put ghosts in that category what people reference as ghosts see ghosts are generally they come out of one's imagination let me let me put it this way the human body has electricity it has because there are chemicals there are metals everything now generally when a person grows old and dies all this electricity slowly fades off and it's gone suppose somebody dies in an accident suddenly what happens to the electric charges forget the soul that's gone what happens to the electric charges which wear in this body and which because they remained in this body have acquired a certain shape just like this body in us what happens they are released that is released and it is wandering around you can't see it and understand special circumstances it may be visible since for a long time it was inside this body it will have the same shape and people will say there is a ghost over time that will disappear because that charge will be lost but believe me it has no intelligence of his own it cannot hurt you because it doesn't it can hurt you by fear of cause you get frightened and you get a heart attack that's not the fault of that rate whatever is there it's the charge that has left the human body because suddenly somebody died while still everything was fresh but the soul is not there in that soul is gone what about people who get possessed by these things i think possession 90 of possession is a psychological disease there is no such person in rare cases it may be but it's not these electrical charges that can possess in rare cases other beings are known to have occupied physical bodies and these are not necessarily ghosts no demonic entities no they need not be demonic they can be good in entities also you know you see when we say invisible we always put it into the demonic category there may be good and they will be bad so there are higher beings around us or different beings which are also good yes of course they are good now here they are good right now because they are encouraging us so now wait a minute now let me tell you this which is why when you sit down and pray you meditate sometimes you feel good because they're helping you sometimes you don't feel because they're doing something else so there are beings there's no question and in fact if you develop the capacity to see you may be able to see them also but for us who are walking on the path to absolute freedom we don't want to get stuck with these beings we need to go further up what is their purpose why are they there they are here because you see their rate of frequency of vibration of their bodies is different from ours right so even if they are here where we are sitting we don't feel them and they don't feel us because there were their frequencies are different can they see us like if they wish some not all can see us some are unconsciously there not even aware that we are here just as we are not aware that they are there among them might be able to see like rare among us may be able to see or feel wonder and see do you feel anything in this house just by nigel this house i feel some meditation energies here probably because you are meditating or somebody is meditating and i also see pictures here of the lineage of lahari mahasha and sri guru babaji so there are some presences here which are positive they're not negative presence yeah yes i'd love to know about angels farishta these things are these the higher good beings that you speak of true so angels are what god's soldiers that is the semitic narrative of angels they're not soldiers or anything they're beings who belong to a different dimension they will not become human beings nor will human beings become angels there are differences there are many species of such beings on this earth not only us homo sapiens and they interpenetrate this world they're also beyond there are also beings who come from other realms which are not of this earth not of this universe or not of this earth sometimes from another universe also [Music] so many questions i have right now so um was it your guru who began to teach you these things yes of course in fact when i went i didn't have much of faith in all these things i wanted to do kriya and i wanted to touch the atman and be free and so on but he said but there are many intermediate things between this and that why did you have to learn about these things because they are facts you need to know them they exist and sometimes they are very helpful to us you can always use them for help and if they are negative you learn about them otherwise how would you avoid them how do you use them for help whenever we sit down and meditate and chant the uh like for instance [Music] vishnu gurudeva such chance when you do then these higher beings who are there to help us they come and influence our minds and help us to be free of distractions things like that suppose there is some problem happening because of the negative influence of such kind of thing always invoke the positive so that it takes care of the it negates the negative these higher beings why would they even cause negativity to us not the higher good beings there are when i say higher i'm talking about that which is not like physical yeah what is beyond the physical they deliberately will not cause harm to you but there are like beings who are can for instance increase your desires now this for a sadaq for instance on the path of spiritual is a dangerous thing so you need to handle it in its own you mean like sexual desire yes and so on and so on okay um wherever there is a lot of sexual activity you find such beings they're not bad per se but they're those who encourage you to carry on with it because they live by it they enjoy it like a bad college friend bad influence exactly but they're good fellows i mean in the same i mean by their own they are okay but for us who are walking in a different direction they may be taking you off yeah gotcha just a little naughty that's right and you may not even know that normally we dismiss it as thoughts but we don't understand that these thoughts could have been infused by someone let's talk about that let's talk about thoughts not being a property of just your own mind no thoughts as far as see i go to a function let's i'm giving you a simple example and somebody is lecturing there talking like what hitler used to do then he goes raving in the end all attention is there right then there is the playing of drums and there is the music playing and there is a flag up your thought is no more yours it's been taken over this is what i mean or circumstances maybe circumstances also also partly circumstances also can take over and change your thinking sometimes you may be say thinking something which will never part of your psyche it may be coming from somebody else or somewhere else okay that is why when you sit down to meditate traditionally they draw a protective circle which is a mind circle of course there's nothing material there and say please keep away thoughts from us so that we can meditate in temples when you see those grotesque figures standing in the gates the duara palakkas they are supposed to be symbols of those keeping away evil things [Music] um [Music] coming back to the story so um you know what's happening right now some of my questions which i find very easy to shoot with in podcast are getting erased and like be coming back to the story so some reason something's telling me to come back to the story something is at work yeah like i'm not i actually had a great ghost related question but i think we'll end that tangent for now uh what happened in those three years in terms of i wish to know other than like the studies you know what was your life like so because i'm assuming you were 20 years old 21 years old at the most 19 20 21 22 where we had to go and beg for food from the villages had an advantage because babaji was known in that area to be a great yogi so wherever even food was provided but we also gone to places where there was no food available babaji could manage without food for days but he was very careful about me he'd always used to manage somehow to get food for me and eat so this and once you are not hungry if the hunger side is looked after the himalayan area is the most beautiful place to be are there parts of the himalayas not explored by humans not i wouldn't say not explored by humans but there are parts which are not in the tourist circuit and which may not be in the tourism some humans have gone yeah i'm sure and what do you see in those paths you see such places where you have herbs which grow which can keep your hunger at bay for a long time you see such beautiful streams with clear water flowing which has herbs already infused in the water you sometimes see great yogis unknown in fact after that i discovered that there are more unknown great yogis than the known ones seriously we know only the known ones and we think they are great there are unknown ones who are greater than anything that you can think of maha is it true that there are certain kriyas and certain yogas that actually change your physical appearance heavily yes what happens the cells start changing the human cells begin to change they get filled with more energy which is normally not available to the human being so they change even physically a kriya yogi no it may look similar to others but there will be some change in him which people can make out when they meet when they talk something about this guy which is uncanny is because it's not a deliberate thing as you practice kriya the cells get charged with energy and therefore they are no longer like an ordinary cell what i've understood from a slightly scientific perspective is that your breathing becomes slower and deeper am i right in saying that yes your breathing becomes slower and deeper but also the prana the life energies which are usually not released from the centers called the plexuses they get released that's also there so your body holds energy in these packets yes which gets opened up opened up and everybody's got those energies as well yes waiting to be open exactly which is why i will now ask you about what kundalini is i have never asked this on the show uh and i know it was an area of interest when you were young and it's been an area of interest throughout your life of course but if someone's never heard of the word kundalini i would love for you to explain it i avoid this word kundalini because today it's a very exploited term every tom dick and harry is raising his kundalini for five hundred dollars today if you go on to the internet that's not kundalini something else i don't know what it is now what is the meaning of the word kundalini kula kundali is called in the tantras now the tantras have two sections one is the mantra ana section it's dealing with mantras where sri vidya and so on comes the yoga tantras are those which deal with this energy in the human body now what does it mean the entire energy of the universe which is complete purna para shakti is the word used by the shaktas this and it is feminine creative energy is always depicted as feminine so this parashakti after having all done all its work in the human being where does it operate first it operates as sex the sex and kundalini are interrelated it is the same energy but in a different way so kundalini if you don't want to shakthi um it's also called bhujangi because it's like a snake in the sense there is no snake there but it's coiled and it raises his hood meaning it awakens this energy through sex creates another human being it's a creative energy right what happens in sex the semen goes into a woman's womb and then a new create new being is created this is created by the same energy which we call kundalini acting through sex which is why somewhere people have got this connection between sex and tantra which of course has been exploited beyond recognition now this energy after having made a child doesn't dissipate it stays where does it stay in the bottom of the spine in the center called the muladhara your lowest chakra your center lowest not in the sense of low and high but in the bottom most physically yeah physically low yes so it stays there and whenever a person has a sexual excitement or enjoyment it is the same energy that operates now the yogi what he does is instead of allowing it to express itself too much in the sexual field he controls it and turns it around and makes it ascend the spine when it ascends the spine then the kundalini or the shakti or whatever you want to call bhujangi becomes a spiritually creative energy just as it becomes a physically creative energy through sex how do you turn it around kriya is one of the practices meant to turn it around from the yoga tantra point of view there is another shastra which is called the mantra some sounds are used and chanted to awaken it but the best thing is a judicious combination of both and what is a fair amount of time if you're disciplined and dedicated to the process now it this is a very difficult question to answer because it all depends on what stage of growth you are and what you have come with from the past depends on these factors but i think so therefore you can't fix a fair amount of time in that kind of way but i think the diligent practice with the understanding that you need to rise above the ordinary can help you to go there but it's very difficult to fix some people happens fast and some people it takes some time the idea is not to give up because it'll carry on into your next book yes and also i feel it's better that it goes slowly and matures rather than suddenly happens because the energy is so powerful that there are cases when it has suddenly happened and the body and the mind is not able to cope with it and people become somewhat semi-crazy when you say crazy what happens suddenly there's a spurt of energy which they don't know how to place how to control they should behave in strange ways and maybe some people might consider them to be possessed yes possible or bad they're not actually mad they're seeing things and hearing things and going with because something has happened in them so i think the best thing is that it happens in a slow pace till the whole mind and body becomes mature to take the impact of the arousal that's why i'm very concerned when people give techniques without preparing the person properly i'm very concerned and because i get people writing to me on mail email and so on saying i went to so and so somebody he taught me this and now what has happened my whole body is shaking something is going up my spine i can't eat and drink i'm suffering please help me now i always tell them look you have to go back to that person and ask what did you learn what did you teach and he should be able to help you then they say he's unreachable if he's unreachable then what kind of a teacher are you you know what i'm trying to do you need a stable uh experienced guru to teach you these things you need a stable person to teach one thing second is you should follow through if you taught somebody something because it's unexplored territory largely and that you don't know where the pitfalls are the poor guy doesn't know so you need to so i make it i do it very carefully i don't generally easily give to people not because i i'm trying to hide it for their own good um so is your kundalini rising the same as you getting enlightenment is it the same amok or nirvana are they two different things according to the yoga sastras generally kyolya or moksha happens when the energy has risen and gone to the sahasrara however i feel and i know that there are cases of people who do not practice kriya yoga or who don't practice kundalini yoga in particular who have also become illumined but it has happened without their conscious effort without their conscious effort so just happened happen because their mind has become so purified and over many lives they have been working towards it they didn't don't need to go through this process it has but it has awakened in some centers it may not have gone through the usual yogi course from muladhara to the sahasrara there are a case of people for him suddenly the energy has opened up in the heart center they suddenly feel that all the bliss and feelings and energies and thoughts and and attention has come to for instance the anahat in their hearts our hearts and there is a great amount of bridge they don't know anything about the mullah nothing it's suddenly come so there are such cases also who have not systematically done the kriya but who have touched that by finding out their true identity by asking questions like who am i am i this body or am i something else and then it can happen so who am i am i this body okay no i'm kidding it's a joke you know who am i it's a very funny thing because there was this great ravana maharshi yeah who discovered well you must remember that at the age of 14 he already had a spiritual experience we say he didn't do any sadhana but he must have done sadhana in his previous lives and he was born a projectile guy as a prodigal child so at the age of 14 he had an experience where he saw that he was not the body he was separate from the body so he said if i'm separate from the body then who am i really am i this body or the mind or something and he attained you cannot never i cannot deny at all that ramana martial touched the highest without going through any kundalini nothing but but then people don't look at his past life i'm not i've not seen his past life but don't don't look at that concept of that that he must have worked towards it and that at this young age he got his experience and then all his sadhana was to consolidate it three four years he just control now it be this being the case with ramana maharshi it need not be the case with everybody so if simply somebody sits down and keeps saying who am i who am i who am i do you think one can find the truth i mean it's a chant it doesn't mean anything just a repetition is it true that if in your heart you have the true and unfiltered desire for a guru the guru will come to you for me i can only say about myself hundred percent as far as i am i wanted a teacher and the teacher came to me they say the teacher appears when the student is ready but the student also needs to want it yes very much if you are at a place where you say if i don't get a proper guide i will i'm going to die definitely there's a teacher but it must be very sincere and one pointed towards that can teach also leave yes if his function is over he can leave and you think gurus change over the course of your life it could you can change you there is no harm in that if somebody says oh you shouldn't go away from me hold on to me it doesn't make sense to me except if you want to go somewhere please go provided it helps i am also not against directing somebody to go somewhere else okay um a little bit early on the show we spoke about dimensions um one thing i've understood about the word shiva and not the god shiva is that shiva is referenced to as the dimension beyond human understanding absolutely i wish to ask you what that even means because it's beyond my understanding like what what what are the dimensions out there there's three dimensions xyz the fourth dimension of time and that's where my mind stops because science hasn't understood even time yet time is just a convenience in mathematical equations right and i've asked some incredibly intelligent astrophysicist shout out to abhijit but i've asked some incredibly intelligent astrophysicists and even they have failed to truly understand what time means no they don't nobody knows what time is it maybe let's begin there so let's begin talking about time and then you can dial it up and take us on the fifth and sixth damage let me start start with this thing about um dimensions okay wherever you wish and shivam the word shiva shivam you know that shiva is a very abstract concept it's not the shankara that we put in a picture of somebody sitting in siddhasana with his eyes closed but even in that picture it is the symbol of a yogi therefore yogi only can understand the fulfillment of the word shivam now in the diagram of shiva you always see a third eye what does that mean that means to understand the concept which is beyond the ordinary dimensions one needs to have a special faculty and that faculty symbolically called the third eye there is nothing here it's symbolic which means that with our present set of sense organs which are our instruments of perception you cannot discover anything which is beyond the third dimension so therefore only when these come into play when your other sensory perceptions open up which are beyond the ordinary then only you can even begin to have an idea of what the next dimension is all about and shivam is the ultimate essence of all dimensions put together this is the word shivam shivam in sanskrit means bliss it means auspiciousness it means the supreme all three words put together so therefore shiva is sometimes depicted also as ardhanari surah half male and half female what does that mean it means that shakti the energy and shivam the ultimate tranquil state and not two different things but two sides of the same kind they when everything is quiet as the state of shiva exists there is no creation there is no movement it's only when there is a movement that the whole thing happened that moment is shakti right so what i'm trying to say to your question is that unless and until we awaken the other instruments of perception in our system we can only theorize about that which is beyond the three dimensions we cannot even understand you you told me about the ant thing a very good example let me give you another example there are there is a plastic transparent box in which which is divided vertically top is open divided vertically with another transparent wall this side there are small wafer thin red beings let's say this side small wafer thin green beings then they know only two dimensions which is this way or this way they are so thin they don't even know that there is any thickness okay now they have seen that the other side looks more beautiful and more green than this side they would very much like to go there but they cannot because they don't know how to go there is a wall in the middle the concept that they can go like this doesn't arise in their minds they are only in that dimension but they see that some have reached there how did they reach there we would also like to go so they attempt to move and move and press and press some of them realize that this is not going to work so they sit down quietly in one corner that's when somebody picks them up and puts them this side when they're moving you cannot even pick them up i don't know so what i'm trying to say is one way of reaching out to that dimension which you cannot go because you are not accustomed to anything beyond three dimensions is to sit quiet and still meditate more still when the stillness happens then you're you're lifted from some dimension ordinary and put to something else because this is not linear like the truth is there or something is there the other dimension is there and i am here and i want to reach that it doesn't work that way because it is here there and everywhere so how do i experience by not reaching out anywhere but everything is quiet stay where you are and work your perception to be yours yes at a higher place yes this will take us slowly to the understanding at least to begin with in the mind about something which is beyond the three dimensions what is time so what was happening 50 years back is it also happening now time is based on change i'm not talking about the physics point of view practical point of view time depends on change if there was no change you cannot reckon time everything is same there is no time okay one second time is a very relative and psychological concept also or even though the watch may show one hour in the same time if this conversation was boring one would be wondering when is this going to end such a long time has been going on this may be the same mechanical time suppose it is interesting when it is over i would say oh my god is ended that was very short so is time just a physical thing or is it also psychological plus creatures like a mosquito for instance we said it lives for two days but for the mosquitoes not two days this mosquito was born then it became whatever like a worm then it shed its tail and it became growings and it became a mosquito and then it looked for food it drank our blood or whoever's blood and then it reproduced it had a family and so on and then it died two days later two or three i don't know what the lifespan for us it is two days and three days for the mosquito believe me it's an entire lifetime where is this time now which is time this all this so time measured in physical ways is one thing and time actually is another thing all together so it's it's very linked to your psychology to your mind what is its purpose like why did god place this element not god's like like saying what is gravity and why is it there it is there you can only accept it you cannot even try to find a reason for it if time is the fourth dimension what is the fifth one what's the next one i'm sure we graduate i haven't thought about this but i think time is not the next dimension going beyond time is the next dimension let's talk about that so when i say going beyond time first to theoretically accept that time is a psychological factor how do you go beyond it what does that even mean do you mean like freezing time no understanding time understanding what is time through understanding then the time disappears then you you understand that this time which we know of by the clock is not the real time and we think that this life is birth and death we're born and we die but i know many yogis also know for certain that this is not neither the beginning nor the end of our life it's going on from the beginning for nobody knows even the origin actually nobody even the yogi doesn't know where it originate but it is going on continuously and it will continue till we put a stop to it till we put a stop to it yes when we realize that this is endless and it's useless we don't want to come all the time and say okay seize enough then only you can put a stop to others you cannot put it what do you think is the future of the human race i think human race has to evolve further it has still come to a point we think they are in the highest level of evolution and now an artificial intelligence comes tick via i think we are still in the what you call the uh this lobe of the brain the frontal lobe of civilization we need to go beyond it the human race cannot just stand here it needs to move further by the speaking of the brain let's talk about the pineal gland so what the west understands as the third eye firstly is it the third eye are there capacities in our mind that get unlocked uh specifically because of the pineal gland and i don't know if you're familiar with dmt uh i would love to hear what you think of these concepts because that's how the west understands enlightenment ayahuasca if you've heard of it um i would love to know what you think so i would personally let me start with this not appreciate anybody getting stuck to ayahuasca or any such kind of thing because temporarily yes it makes you understand that there are things which are not known to the ordinary mind yes but that's where it stops if you need to develop you need to develop your brain cells to that level which means you need to do other practices including kriya of course now as far as the pineal gland is concerned i know that it there is a lot of everybody is talking about penile gland now a church of pineal gland is the spiritual organ let me put it this way uh till 60 70 years ago the penile gland was considered to be a vestige organ appendix and then sometime before laters people discovered that no it has a very important function which the biologists called the circadian rhythm the sleep and waking search it is the video when everything is dark and there's good music then the pineal gland injects a little bit of melatonin into our bloodstream and we feel nice uh when we say we are in good meditation deep it means some hormone is injected into a bloodstream dmt or some other hormone i can't remember the names and so we feel good so that is also quite chemical in content now through yoga you can make it happen deliberately and consciously that's all the time yeah that's one side of the story now therefore if the pineal gland or melatonin when you have a jetlag doctor asks you to take melatonin which is the same thing produced by the pineal gland now if it really if it's a fact that it produces sleep it has something to do with sleep now in vedanta go to the mandu upanishad the states of consciousness of the human being have been described as waking state dream state deep sleep and something beyond which is called turiya now deep sleep is the last state that has been discussed and described because turiyas cannot be defined and pineal gland and melatonin has something to do with sushubti or deep sleep the borderline between deep sleep and turia is very thin so when uh to the difference between turiya and sushupti or deep sleep is just that in sushupti one has no recognition outside and no cognition inside but one is apparently in great deal of bliss because nobody wants to wake up from deep sleep because we are enjoying but while we are enjoying deep sleep we are not aware of it right only when we wake up we feel ah that was such a blissful sleep but if you feel it now and remember it that means somebody was actually experiencing that bliss so in that deep sleep state if one can practical bubble not possible but it can theoretically wake up then from deeply one has entered turiyah and what is all pervading state of blissfulness which everybody is aiming to get at god god you can call if you like it's like an ocean of god ocean of awareness and bliss okay so the thin line between therefore attention and the penal gland and meditation on that area around it can take probably take us from deep sleep into turya this is where it becomes important i also think that it can be controlled by mind what do you mean i mean it's even though it is an organ which is deep inside the brain it can be made to increase or decrease its level of hormone release into the brain stream into the bloodstream through thought through visualization visualization attention one point in attention calming the mind and equalizing the breath the oldest reference to kriya comes in the gita in the sixth chapter of the gita which is called yoga krishna says arjuna sit straight keep your spine and head steady fix your attention in the broom at the other center between your eyebrows which is what takes you to the inside to the fenian grind then balance your breath says kriya and be free it's a simple meditation you've just given also no no seriously this is no it's from the gita krishna beautifully describes it he says sit steady keep your spine steady head steady neck steady okay now fix your attention in the brew mateya equalize your breath and go out and be free be reach kaio the word use there so i think we began this podcast based on um your story and we've gone very far away from it but i love podcasts like this is where the real joy of podcasting comes into play there has been one particular topic that people have been very inclined towards on the internet lately which is the yeti and uh under every video we've ever created about yetis your name comes up is it yes why is that simply because i happen to mention that when i wanted to go to the to kailash it was an unsuccessful attempt bhavaji said okay cello so we didn't go to the usual route any of the routes that are being used now the road was completely different nobody goes nowadays through that route we went through the indo-tibetan border into kakabushindi and crossed across we came to a village where there is a tibetan buddha which is so huge that its head is above the roof and there we stop for the night beyond that i couldn't because i got high fever my temperature rose and i was in delirious uh and so on so there were some nepalese people walking with us they were the fellows who used to cook some other merchants also with us and these fellows so i was inside the tent and i was sleeping i woke up i woke up because i suddenly found that my temperature has gone down and i was feeling uh slightly okay and i'm thinking where am i i even forgot i said where am i where is babaji nowhere to be seen and i was lying in the pettit the only lamp for the kerosene lantern they have inside then i suddenly thought somebody was i thought it was the nepalese guy who was bringing my soup or something somebody came in something came in and i was astonished i was not suffering from any delusion of delirium there was a huge person standing there with the light of that lantern i could hardly see much but i knew that it is a furry kind of person the first doubt was it was that it is a bear but no it was standing like a human being i couldn't see the features much but it came near me and it made a very eerie noise like like i don't know how to it's like a whistle but it's not i don't know that kind of no no it's actually e sound kind of e e sound and then it took something and put it into my mouth stuffed something into my mouth it was a bitter thing i couldn't uh spit it out i swallowed it and it ran up by the time that badur came running inside and this one went off this i mentioned in my autobiography which is why the city thing came coming and later on i even thought it was some kind of a himalayan ape or something babaji told me later on that it was an 80 and he said you would have died with this fever i said but i had recovered he said no it would have come again for eight days it is some kind of a mountain fever which usually takes the person at the end he said this he said they are good people they are not what people think and fear he brought a herbal medicine and stuffed it into your mouth otherwise you would have died and third day we returned do you remember the face you know it was dark there was only that hurricane lamp there at low flame i can't exactly remove the face but i can tell you it was broader and bigger than a human face this much i can tell you were you scared at all i was scared of course i was scared i want i couldn't scream because i got so scared that my the sound stuck in my throat i couldn't even scream but before that all this was done split second kind of what energy did you feel from it i didn't feel anything i think i smelled something like suppose some furry animal like a dog comes near that kind of smell beyond that i didn't feel it what do you think is the yeti's purpose babaji said he came to help you beyond that i don't know generally like yetis generally why do you think they're there i don't know i have not even thought about it because this is the first time and the last time i had an experience but from this i came to understand that there are such such living creatures in the in the remote parts of mountains and caves and forests which we don't believe because we don't see them so often yeah and people underestimate how big mountains and forests are very big we don't know a thing nothing to compare with any of the national forest that we have there are many unknown places [Music] while i do wish to ask you everything else about your lifestyle i know we're constrained a little bit with time which is why i'm going to bring in a question sent in by my uncle um he has read all your books and i said that you know is this something you really wish for me to bring up as a great introductory aspect of shrimp to the audiences he said uh i would love to know a little bit more about the nagas and you know what they were who who are they what was their purpose um this is some chapter which i am very reluctant to open up but the nagas that we have today and i'm talking about the hooded serpents not the unhooded serpent cobras cobras the hooded cobras that we have especially the scissor mark guys there are kind of i don't know what word to use once upon a time they belong to a species of beings that lived in another realm all together in ancient times they were our teachers they taught us many things the nagas which is why the nagas are worshiped as symbols of wisdom even the kundalini is considered to be naga [Music] what we have today is a totally dis uh oh what do you call it um there's some word for it i'm sorry i don't mean like a reduced version not reduced you know like decadent decalint is the word i was looking for a decanted decadent leftovers of dutch species which we have today because other nagas all disappeared they have gone back to the realms the reason why they became decarent is because then they started having relationship with human beings so they were recalled and those who were left behind is what we see today that the species of serpents the cobras what do you think the intelligence of a cobra is is it beyond what we know brush that we have today are not that intelligent as their forefathers who were our teachers but they are definitely more intelligent that we think as a normal snake the unhooded snake for instance now this is controversial if i say this the biologist says this is not true yeah but we know that the cobras one thing i can tell you to my understanding the kobras do not bite unless they think they are threatened now listening to music and shaking is not real because cobras do not hear they only pick up vibrations from the ground they cannot hear they don't have ears instruments but they can sense the rhythm okay now one thing i have noticed also is that kobras recognize somebody in whom the kundalini is active um are you comfortable just talking about where the ancestors have gone just back to nagaloka is in their realm called nagalooka where they have gone back and i had an encounter in which i really saw somebody from there in dharun that he came but they come back to visit very rarely this was a very rare instance they don't generally not okay without delving too much into detail sir after your three years with your guru why did you come back babaji said go back all right i wouldn't have come back i would have stayed quietly there i was very happy i told baba i don't want to go and get stuck he said no it's your plan in life to teach is to go back get married settle down and teach because i want you to know what the ordinary human being goes through without that you won't be able to teach so you have to go through it go back and also he told me not to teach till i got a green signal from him so i never thought for many years many years i listened to what others are saying and kept quiet and did not teach a word till the age of 42 but you were practicing your creations of course and day by day it was expanding the mind were you also learning more in those years i was just learning what i had already learned i was relearning it to make it more clear when i tell other people because i knew at some point i will have to teach i was preparing myself actually your purpose in this life is to just relay the information that you have gained purpose in this life is to make people understand that in every living being especially in a human being because human beings can recognize it other living beings cannot that there is a divine element in all living beings in all human beings and the divine element is the essence of our being and if you turn our mind round and look if you find it that is the aim of life to take the human from the ordinary to that which is beyond this is my aim in life yes so uh thank you for this conversation i think we're at the end of it so genuinely hope to have many many more conversations with you because i'm quite comfortable with you so that we'll see some of the time we can i hope i didn't make you uncomfortable in any part any case i don't get uncomfortable but i find something okay there is no problem thank you sir one last question before i let you leave which is uh any piece of advice for me personally continue with what you're doing because while you have you also have discussions with people from all uh wakes of life all kinds of people but while doing that please keep this in mind that the spiritual aspect is a very important part of life and when it goes from young people like you other young people will get interested in it and try to because the ultimate aim of life is to expand spiritually so while you may be doing other things keep this definitely this part of it going all the time because you will become more and more famous i know it as it becomes and it is expands don't miss the spiritual part of it sri i'm so thank you um i don't know what to say other than thank you thank you very much for bringing it out from me because i'm generally sometimes quite reluctant to discuss thank you to bring it out in a very friendly nice way i mean i just i hope the audience has listened to this particular episode very intently and i hope you'll re-listen to it because even between the sentences spoken there was a lot of messages and uh information so thank you i'm hoping to welcome you back on the show thank you very much when we began recording this podcast i thought i would cover this entire man's life journey over the course of one episode and i was wrong i only got to cover his origin stories and probably the second chapter where he met his guru usually in outros i talk about what a podcast made me feel in this outro i just want to welcome sharia i'm back on the show because we need to hear more about the story we need to learn more from shariam we need to rise along with all this knowledge that's currently rising in the world all over the world they say that india is the hub of culture the hub of spirituality even when we're talking about the whole world what i mean by that is the whole world turns to india when it comes to spiritual growth when it comes to philosophy when it comes to the deeper meaning of life and i hope that this podcast helped you find that slightly deeper meaning of life do share it with your friends i know that some of these concepts sometimes can seem too far-fetched for the average listener but hey true knowledge is knowing that we know nothing right and keeping that in mind of course i'm gonna ask you to follow us on spotify every episode's available in spotify 48 hours before it's available anywhere else in the world this was sriam appearing only for the first time on this show so it's promised that he's going to be back soon and i can't wait to record a sequel episode this one in the description box i

克里希納和《吉他》對阿朱納說 我是給予記憶的人 我也是抹去記憶的人 你知道抹去記憶的事發生在每個人身上 實際上每個人都有這種情況 在我們製作的關於雪人的所有視頻中 你的名字都出現了 是嗎 是的 爲什麼會這樣 只是因爲我碰巧提到 當我想去卡拉什的時候 我知道這是一個毛茸茸的人，第一個疑問是，這是一隻熊，但不是，它像一個人一樣站在那裏，他說他們是好人，他們不是人們所想的那樣，而且很害怕，他帶來了一種草藥，把它塞進你的嘴裏，否則你會死的。這不是針對懷疑論者的談話，而是針對信徒的談話，但在這次與Sri M的談話中，他是一位著名的作家和精神領袖，我們確實討論了懷疑論，然後繼續討論了他所有的人生經歷，有幾位嘉賓，我知道這個人有20個播客 而Shriyam就是其中之一，這只是與這個人的第一次談話，他談到了一切，從雪人、惡魔到來自其他領域的生命，以及在人類生存方面的精神成長的意義，精神的目的是什麼，冥想的目的是什麼，以及這些其他實體在哪裏，這些科學 我強烈建議你嘗試收聽整個對話，我也強烈建議你在Spotify上關注我們，體驗Spotify的獨家服務，這意味着每一集都可以在世界其他地方的48小時之前在Spotify上獲得，這是Shreem第一次出現在Ranvi節目中，美麗的對話正在向你靠近。我很高興你今天來參加這個節目 我真的不知道該從哪裏開始和你談話 我很想看到和你的這些談話 因爲有很多東西要和你說 我想說的是你的生活經歷 但我想說的是你的靈魂經歷 但也許要和你開始一個系列 我很想知道關於這一生 先生 首先你今天怎麼樣 我很好 但我一般都是這樣 你知道盡管有什麼事情發生 我很高興你給我打電話，我知道你是做什麼工作的，所以我的想法是，就像《吉他》中的sarvatra samabuddha，意思是在任何情況下都要保持平靜，所以通過提問你怎麼樣，我很好，我很好[笑]哇，我有點困惑，這是我所有這些情節的慣常啓動方式，但是，呃，讓我們從這一生開始，你在這一生中最早的記憶是什麼，我在這一生中最早的記憶在這個身體裏 直到9歲，我都不太記得了，除了大家都記得的正常記憶，但在我有了獨特的經歷，我的大師馬赫斯瓦爾沒有把手放在我的頭上，說了一句話，之後我就開始有了以前的記憶，我有過記憶，以前沒有人問過我這個問題，我有過被封閉在某個黑暗房間的記憶，你知道，作爲一個小小的胚胎，沒有力量，不能移動，但在記憶裏湧現了過去，然後有一天 突然間，所有的記憶都消失了，我也出來了，然後我只有關於這一生的記憶，直到我開始深入我的意識層，追溯爲什麼會發生這樣的事情，它從哪裏開始的，我怎麼會在這種情況下出現，這是很晚的事情，因爲在某些時候，你知道記憶在你出來之前就被切斷了 克里希納在《薄迦梵歌》中對阿朱納說，我是給予記憶的人，我也是抹去記憶的人，你知道，抹去的事情發生了 其實每個人都有這些記憶，有些人後來才發現，有些人在這一生中根本沒有發現，這就是唯一的區別。 我想把你帶回與你的大師的會面，我希望你能描述一下，因爲這就是網上關於你的信息，如果有人沒有讀過你的書，就可以看到這一段記載，它是關於這一段記載如何成爲你這一生旅程的開始，非常真實。我想了解一下你的導師和導師的概念。 我九歲時出生在喀拉拉邦的一個穆斯林移民家庭，我的祖先是特拉萬科大君的警衛，我們就是這樣來的，因爲後來我們定居了。當我年輕的時候，我們家的後院非常長，非常大，很多鄰居的朋友都來玩，到了6點半，他們都回家了，只有我一個人，這種情況幾乎每天都在發生。因爲我從來沒有見過這樣的人 我很喫驚，因爲我不知道那個人是怎麼來的，後來我推斷，也許他是跳到院牆上來的，那裏有一部分舒適的知識，但我很喫驚，因爲在那個年齡，九歲的時候，他看起來很高，後來我發現，但他看起來很高，我從來沒有見過一個有頭髮的人，他的頭髮在這裏都被打亂了，很白皙 很高，除了一塊小布，沒有上衣 他手裏拿着一個奇怪的東西 後來我才知道，那是一個指揮官 他的脖子上戴着一個巨大的蘆薈花環 當時我還不知道什麼是蘆薈花環 所以當我看到的時候，我在想這是誰？ 這傢伙是從哪裏來的？ 他就這樣用手拿着椅子 好吧，當夜晚即將來臨的時候，自然會有什麼反應 陌生人叫你，看起來很奇怪 反應是大膽的，但我覺得我必須去，所以我走近他，然後我和他面對面站着，不是面對面，因爲他比我高，所以他問我，你還記得什麼嗎 我說不記得，因爲我不知道他在問什麼 記得他說不記得，然後他說他把手放在我頭上 他用印地語說，但我用英語告訴你 他說當時間到了，你會記得一切，一切都會好的 然後他說回去，我走了 我還在想這裏發生了什麼，我只記得我帶着的是我們的那雙大眼睛，它們困擾着我，就像很多年前一樣 我走回去，我知道我走到了後面的廚房，我媽媽正在做飯，現在我想回頭看看，但我不能，只有當我爬上臺階，走到後門時我才能回頭，那裏沒有人，所以我說，但這不是一個願景，這是一個意外。因爲我還能感覺到那隻手在我頭上 你知道有種溫暖的感覺 我想告訴我媽媽，但我說不出話來 除了這件事，我什麼都能說出來 很多年來都是這樣被鎖住的 我進屋吃了點東西 從那天開始，我的生活發生了很大的變化 我從來沒有學過冥想，我是怎麼開始的 那天晚上，我睡覺的時候，呃，大概是午夜的時候 我感覺有人在叫醒我 我感覺到有人在叫醒我，但不像是有人在那裏，我在肚臍處感覺到了某種溫暖的感覺，還有光，就像你在屠妖節上用的這些東西，煙花，旋轉的圓形東西，這裏有東西在動，然後它擴散到整個身體，有一種幸福的感覺，這是我第一次冥想，發生的第一個變化，這每天都發生，對不起，每天晚上我都不會坐起來，因爲我想如果我坐起來 因爲我想如果我坐起來，我們都會睡在一個大牀上，你知道，在過去的日子裏，就像加入家庭一樣，所以我經常躺下，這樣做，我開始理解許多事情，然後我有了這種慾望，想閱讀關於開放的襯衫，後來隨着我的成長，我經常去圖書館，閱讀任何我可以得到的書籍，許多時候，我的冥想開始加深，但最有趣的是，恰好發生了一些情況，我將遇到 我在特里凡得琅地區遇到了一些被認爲是聖人的人，他們都是瑜伽師，我從他們那裏得到了很多祝福，有時還得到了一些指示，這種情況一直持續到我19歲，我寫了我的考試，然後在19歲的時候，我覺得我必須移動，他們給你什麼樣的指示，有時指示是口頭的，有時指示是非口頭的。 有一位斯瓦米-阿貝達-南達，他住在第四區，那裏的帕德馬納瓦-斯瓦米寺廟不是很有名，但他有以下的情況，我也經常在星期六和星期天去那裏，有時從我們的自行車上走過去，他會讓我坐在他附近，他知道我在做某種練習。他知道我在做一些與昆達里尼和所有這些有關的練習，我沒有指示在這裏和那裏閱讀各種東西，他告訴我，哦，你不必做所有這些，只要Bhakti就夠了，說神的名字，你知道諸如此類的事情，他堅持要我和他一起喫東西，然後去這些 這些都是一些口頭指示，有時我會去，例如，有一個叫戈帕拉-斯瓦米的人，戈帕拉-斯瓦米被稱爲戈帕拉-皮拉-斯瓦米，他的名字是，他實際上是特里凡得琅會計部門的一個職員，但他是一個非常高級的瑜伽師，他未婚，但他從不穿戴任何繩子。在我12歲的時候，我經常去附近的房子裏學數學，他們的數學很弱，所以有人指導我，有一天我去了，他們說今天沒有課，我說怎麼了，沒有斯瓦米來了，所以沒有看到哪個斯瓦米來了？
他的母親出來說，進來吧，所以我去了那裏，我看到這個人坐在那裏，身材很好，剪着短髮，沒有任何斯瓦米的跡象，但他的布像這樣交叉綁着，我一進去，他就說馬拉雅拉姆語，來這裏坐下，他把他的手放在我的頭上按摩，然後他告訴他們，非常好的孩子，非常好的孩子，在我手裏這有這個非 我的思想正在發生變化，我開始看到......比起她來，我覺得有一些東西遠遠超出了我們通常所認爲的，這個世界並不是一個三維的世界。 這個世界不是一個三維的世界，在它之外還有其他的東西，我也感覺到我的使命是在最終的無限的至高無上中找到最終的幸福，而不是滿足日常的事情。 我也覺得我的使命是在終極的、無限的、至高無上的事物中尋找最終的幸福，而不是滿足我們當時通常所想的那樣 所以這開始發生了，我得問問你的旅程，我們又回到了19歲 通常，青少年就像成年的開始，你開始在你的頭腦中獲得最初的幾滴哲學，你開始質疑生命、目的和這些事情，是這樣嗎？ 但在19歲那年，我開始認真思考，在我開始相信這些事情之前，我需要有一個非常具體的經驗。我有過一些經驗，但我想，我所處的環境對我沒有幫助 我在內心深處也有一種感覺，在喜馬拉雅山的某個地方，有人在等着我去教書，特別是喜馬拉雅山，就像你以前想的那樣 是的，一些雪山，我不知道他是不是雪山，我走在上面，有人站在那裏，這種想法 這種想法經常出現，部分原因可能是我想去尋找答案，我也讀到過偉大的瑜伽師住在那裏，但這是他們一直在重複的事情，我也覺得在這種情況下，我在家裏，因爲我是唯一的孩子，我是印度唯一的男孩子，這是一件大事，應該接管你的家庭事務，然後我就有一種感覺，我在一個籠子裏，我想衝出來。我想衝出這個籠子 那是一個金色的籠子 好吧，很多人寧願呆在金色的籠子裏，但我想打破它 籠子是一個籠子，你寫的是木頭或金子 所以它就像一隻不能飛的鳥 有一天，我決定我只是去 你知道，那些日子沒有谷歌，沒有地圖，沒有任何東西 所以我曾經找了一段時間的鐵路指南，找到了去喜馬拉雅山的地方 裏什克什在哪裏 有一天，我終於離開了，我帶了一些錢，我從來沒有自己走過這麼遠的路，但是我就去了，我遇到了很多問題，我有一些錢，去哪裏找食物，怎麼坐火車，一直到現在，我的意思是，很冷，我沒有意識到我需要一些溫暖的衣服，等等，我受了很多苦，甚至在我坐火車到達瑞詩凱詩之後，我受了很多苦，所以我想讓我住在一些修行院裏，至少照顧一下我的身體。所以我住進了神聖生活協會，斯瓦米-奇加南達是那個協會的負責人，我遇到了他，我經常和他聊天，但他也知道我不會留在那裏，他說你要走了，我不認爲會留在這裏，然後有一天我離開了，然後我開始步行，從瑞詩凱詩到巴德里納特，我決定步行，當我到達Vashishtagofa的時候，那裏離得很近，有20公里。我的腿都腫了，我不能再走了 我去了山洞，那裏有一個斯瓦米吉，他在9個月前去世了 他照顧我，他說不要去任何地方，留下來 他也來自喀拉拉邦，所以有共同的語言，等等 他照顧我，後來，我沒有停留一天，我繼續走，我在這裏和那裏遇到了一些人，一些修行院 哇，我花了一個月零十天還是什麼的 如果我沒記錯的話，你在路上有什麼瘋狂的經歷嗎？ 是的，我遇到了幾個游泳的人，而不是一些瑜伽士，我還遇到了一些抽大麻的人，他們不是斯瓦米，但看起來像一些人，各種事情都發生在我身上，我遇到了聰明的人，他們非常簡單，我去了，我記得在晚上，我去了一個阿斯拉姆，有一個Vaishnavite sadhu，三個標記到處都是，我想有一些我去了，我總是告訴他們 我總是告訴他們我是誰，我叫什麼名字，我從哪裏來 你說得很好，說普法會結束了，你和我一起喫吧 普法會結束後，他們去了Ganga Dharati，回來後，他說來吧，讓我們聊一聊，他說很好，你的意圖很好，但我要告訴你，如果你參加Sannyas，放棄世界，需要老年人，你必須非常小心，因爲 你要確定你已經準備好了 他說如果有人爬上臺階去山頂 如果你從第一或第二級臺階上摔下來，你不會受傷 如果你上去摔下來，你將無法恢復，你會摔斷四肢 這是說如果你的測試失敗一次，你是的，好的，所以他給了我一些警告，比如要小心，但在放棄世界的旅程中會出什麼問題？但在放棄世界的過程中會出現什麼問題呢？ 我們還沒有準備好，不知道我們要去做什麼，然後我們發現生活太艱難了，要麼你屈服於誘惑，仍然穿着長袍，要麼你屈服於誘惑，離開一切，回到世界。那就變成了雙重生活 最好是說好吧，我不能這樣做，然後回去 所以他以這種方式警告我 你知道阿倫德的太陽甘尼薩 他的父親在他妻子還年輕的時候就成了桑尼薩，所以她懷孕了，他就跑了，去了根尼，不是他的瑜伽師 有一天，甘尼薩來到阿倫德，那裏有一棵樹，女人應該繞着樹走，讓自己擺脫煩惱 所以他看到一位年輕的女士正在祈禱，說我懷孕了，請把孩子的父親帶回來，他停下腳步，爲她祝福，並說Tatars，然後他問她誰是你的丈夫，她說他是他的弟子，他從未告訴過他，所以他去說回去，這不是辦法，所以他回來了。但他的導師希望他這樣做，所以他回來了，所以他們被排斥在社會之外，故事是這樣的：有一次，學者們正在進行吠陀討論，當時所有的孩子都成了偉大的瑜伽士，包括Ganeshwar uh mukta bhai，他的妹妹也成了瑜伽士，他的哥哥成了另一個瑜伽士。他走在路上，看到人們在誦讀吠陀經，於是他也去參加了，他來自一個懂得吠陀經的家庭，他們說這是那個回來的桑尼亞斯的同胞，你知道他問他不能在這裏上去，你不能誦讀吠陀經，故事是這樣的：格涅沙叫來一頭在路上行走的水牛，把手放在水牛身上，說在水牛身上誦讀，這就是故事，我們不知道很多事情。你知道我的神話和現實有時會混爲一談，但這是一個例子，所以像這樣，我遇到了幾個人，然後我去了Rishik，在那裏我遇到了Rawalji，首先可能是Bodhina寺廟的牧師，自從Adi Shankara的時代，他恢復了Badri寺廟，他決定這裏的牧師必須是來自喀拉拉邦的ambudri，有吠陀家族的人被選中，他們有五年的任期。 我去見了他，我告訴他我來自這樣那樣的地方，我誠實地告訴他我是誰，我在尋找一位大師，我想在Burke的喜馬拉雅山脈有一些瑜伽師，我得到了最令人沮喪的回應，他說你應該回去，因爲這裏沒有這樣的人，抽大麻的Zadoos回去，他還說你是一個受過教育的人，爲什麼你在這裏浪費時間，回去做。我說我什麼都聽，但我說你能不能給我找個地方住一段時間 他說我會的，他給我找了個Kutia，在Dal Canada的另一邊，所以我住在那裏，我經常去那裏喫Prasad，每天在Puja之後我都會呆在那裏，他們經常打牌 所以我有點幻滅了，我燒燬了我的橋樑，現在在這裏 所以有一個地方 呃，在印度村莊的最後一個村莊是Mana，在邊界上，30公里之後你就可以看到西藏的印度-西藏邊界 我想也許我會走那條路，因爲我聽說在Vasundara瀑布和其他地方有洞穴或瑜伽士，所以我在晚上散步，當時很冷，我有毯子和毛衣，然後我經過Vyasa Gopha，那裏有一個Vyasa Gufa。我繼續往前走，到了Mana交叉路口，然後我去看了看，岩石上有一些洞穴，但那裏沒有人，其中一個洞穴有一個固定的門，有人把它鎖上了，然後走了，我說好吧，我們回去吧，我就要來了，那時候天已經黑了 那時候我覺得很想自殺，因爲我想似乎沒有什麼對我有用，也許是因爲這個身體，也許如果我下次在不同的情況下回來，不同的身體，也許會有效果，所以我來到阿拉卡南達的邊緣，我考慮要自殺，實際上我說讓我結束我的生命吧 但我擔心我可能會受苦，我只是在想，水漲的聲音很大，我只是在想，你認爲我會受多少分鐘的苦呢，我只是在想，反正我說讓我冥想一會兒，然後做個決定，所以我回到了維薩
   我看到外面有火，我說一定有人，因爲我去那邊的時候沒有人，我就進去了，Bhavajis 我的Sonat Bhavaji站了起來，還是那個大師 是的，我知道那雙眼睛 那雙大眼睛一直在我身邊，他的第一個反應是 哦，在這裏和那裏徘徊之後，你又回到了我身邊 所以我告訴他我永遠不會離開你，他說我們會考慮一下，然後笑了 所以我和他呆了三年半幾乎 是的，我幾乎和他呆在一起，他去哪裏我就去哪裏，我跟着他，我向他學習，他教給我大學裏可以教的東西，也許是十年，兩年，一年，他沒有帶書，甚至他認爲開放，當他教《吉塔》時，他的開放來自於他的頭腦，所以在那三年裏，我想說這對我來說是一種速成課程。但最主要的是我開始發現這個人不是一個普通人 有時我還沒有想到什麼，他就知道我要想什麼了 因爲我學到的所有經文 吠陀經、奧義書、瑜伽經和Gorak 不知何故，他也是一個Athbanti 所以Gaura knight koraksha sataka siddha siddhanta padari的教義都在他那裏，他從不帶書，我從他那裏學到了什麼 我認爲你們主要集中在練習某種形式的克里雅瑜伽，或者是，不是某種形式的克里雅瑜伽，好吧，不，巴巴吉教給我所有不同的流派，比如在印度的傳統中，我們有五個達薩那，現在，參議院的意思是哲學流派，但達薩那這個詞的意思是面對面，所以無論什麼哲學流派，最終都是爲了讓你與真理面對面，這就是所有達薩那的目的。有Sankhya，有Uttara mamsa，有Vedanta，當然還有瑜伽，這些都是darsanas，所以我一點一點地學習了所有這些，所有的文本都是必須要理解的，但是你爲什麼要學習所有這些，因爲你說明天你會得到一個教學任務，你應該知道所有的東西，因爲來到你身邊的人都會變成不同的領域，你會遇到Swamis，瑜伽師，不同的學者，你需要知道他們是怎麼說的，所以我經歷了這些。我經歷了這一切，但我的修行是克里雅 你能向聽衆解釋一下什麼是克里雅嗎？ 我不能用這種詞來形容克裏雅，但克里雅這個詞在瑜伽經書中的意思是一種修行，這些都是不同的，但當我們說，當我說克里雅時，我說的是那套特別的克里雅教義，是由Sri Guru Bhavaji傳給我們的，不是我的主人，而是他的主人。是由Yogananda兄弟根據Yogananda swami的描述繪製的 所以是Yogananda paramahamsa首先創造了Mahathar babaji這個詞，因爲他說許多化身來了又走了，但這個人在那裏待了很久，他應該在那裏待到最後。他應該一直在那裏，直到Kaluga的結束，而我們現在只到了Kalyukana的一半，這是你的大師的大師，是的，所以Maheshwara，但是我們一千年來，在Yogananda swami的書出來之前，他一直被稱爲sri guru 當Garakanath，偉大的Guraknath寫他的文章時，他總是以sri guru namaha開始，然後你會發現messiah，這意味着不是永遠活在這個地方的人，所以在許多傳統中，他被稱爲sri guru babaji，所以當我談論kriya時，是那個kriya，從那個血統傳給我們，但可能還有其他kriya，他的目的是什麼，是把kriya帶回來，因爲你看這是一個非常步驟 - 是的，因爲你看，它是一種非常一步一步的 是的，因爲你看，它是一種很有步驟的、系統的、有條理的超越平凡的方式 對那些沒有聽說過克里雅瑜伽的聽衆來說，它應該是精神進步最快的形式之一 現在，這也取決於其他因素 如果我說我按自己的意願生活，然後如果我做了，那是不行的 你必須遵循耶米尼亞的大衆規則和條例，然後練習，這也取決於你練習的多少 這也取決於你練習的程度，你有多勤奮，你有多仔細，因爲有些仔細是指確保你定期做，確保你不會錯過描述給你的要點，這是一個信念，你把克里雅當作沒有用的，因爲瑜伽經文中的定期練習是必要的，所以事情可以打開。抹去你的意識，從草地到細微處，關注脊柱，這被稱爲Sushumnandi，增長到細微處意味着什麼？最後一根弦，也就是所謂的 "Sushumnandi"，然後頭腦就會變得越來越細，直到最後弄清這個叫做人類的整個物質的起源。但它對我的影響是，它爲我的思想打開了許多維度，它讓我的思想在某一時刻可以從較低的層次轉移到較高的最高層次，在意識的意志中，當你說較高的層次時，你的意思是更接近於神嗎？神性並不是像神學宗教中的神的概念，而是存在於我們體內的神性的火花，這就是神，它不是外面的東西，而是整個宇宙，它被最高的存在所滲透，但它在人類中被認可，因爲它曾經是一個人自己的意識的核心，是一個人自己的存在，這就是Jiva，這就是神，它不是外面的東西，你相信有更高的生命嗎，是的，我相信。我問你這個問題是因爲播客界在全世界都在談論這些事情，我不是，我不相信高等生命，我知道高等生命的存在，無論信仰是什麼意思，我不知道，我相信對我來說，這不是一種信仰，高等生命有很多種類，首先，認爲在這個地球上只有人類是非常可笑的，這是非常有限的思維方式，還有 還有其他的生命，我們看不到他們並不意味着他們不存在，你看不到空氣，但它是存在的，所以現在我們正在談論，對，我們正在談論一些嚴肅的事情，這將導致許多人理解某些事情，相信我，周圍有這些生命在鼓勵，希望幫助說推動，讓它走向世界，你可能看不到它，並不意味着他們不存在，那麼它是 所以你知道就螞蟻而言 我不知道螞蟻是否真的有和我們人類一樣的感知力 但螞蟻肯定不會跳，它只會像直線一樣移動 對，我經常想，即使是在小時候，螞蟻的感知力是什麼？ 是的，當我們可以直線移動時，它不明白 假設你跳，從這裏到那裏，螞蟻不能 這對它來說是個奇蹟，因爲它只知道直線方向 所以我們是更高的存在，對它來說是的，而不是其他小生物，因此對更高的生命來說，我們在未發展的狀態下就像是終點 好吧，很難想象這一切是怎麼回事 你甚至可以從哪裏開始談論更高的生命？你會把鬼魂歸入這一類嗎？ 人們所說的鬼魂一般都是來自於人的想象力，讓我這樣說吧，人的身體有電，因爲有化學物質，有金屬，一切都有，一般來說，當一個人老了，死了，這些電就會慢慢消失，不見了，假設有人在事故中突然死亡，電荷會怎麼樣？忘了靈魂吧，它已經消失了 電荷會發生什麼，它們穿在這個身體裏，因爲它們留在這個身體裏已經獲得了某種形狀，就像我們的這個身體一樣 會發生什麼，它們被釋放出來，它四處遊蕩，你看不到它，在特殊情況下，它可能是可見的，因爲它在這個身體裏有很長一段時間，它將有同樣的形狀，人們 人們會說，隨着時間的推移，有一個鬼魂會消失，因爲那個電荷會消失，但相信我，它沒有自己的智慧，它不能傷害你，因爲它沒有，它可以通過恐懼來傷害你，因爲你受到了驚嚇，你得到了心臟病發作，這不是那個比率的錯，不管是什麼，都是離開人體的電荷，因爲突然有人死亡，而一切都很新鮮 但靈魂已經不在了 靈魂已經不在了 那被這些東西附身的人呢？ 我認爲附身是一種心理疾病，沒有這樣的人 在少數情況下可能是，但不是這些電荷可以附身 在少數情況下，其他生物也會佔據肉體 這些不一定是鬼魂，也不是惡魔的實體 不，他們不需要是惡魔 他們也可以是好的實體 你知道嗎，當我們說看不見的時候，我們總是把它歸入惡魔的範疇，可能是好的，也可能是壞的 所以我們周圍有更高的生命或者不同的生命，它們也是好的 是的，當然它們現在在這裏是好的，因爲它們正在鼓勵我們 所以現在等一下，讓我告訴你，這就是爲什麼當你坐下來祈禱，打坐時 有時你感覺很好，因爲他們在幫助你，有時你感覺不到，因爲他們在做別的事情，所以有生命存在，這是毫無疑問的，事實上，如果你發展了視覺能力，你可能也能看到他們，但對於我們這些走在絕對自由道路上的人來說，我們不想被這些生命纏住，我們需要進一步瞭解他們的目的是什麼，他們爲什麼在那裏，他們在這裏
   因爲你看他們身體的振動頻率與我們的不同，所以即使他們在我們坐的地方，我們也感覺不到他們，他們也感覺不到我們，因爲他們的頻率不同，他們能看到我們嗎，如果他們願意的話，有些人不是全部能看到我們，有些人是無意識地在那裏。甚至不知道我們在這裏，就像我們不知道他們在那裏一樣 他們可能會看到，就像我們中的少數人可能會看到或感覺到奇蹟，看看你在這所房子裏有什麼感覺嗎？ 就在Nigel這所房子裏，我感覺到一些冥想的能量，可能是因爲你在冥想或者有人在冥想 我還看到了Lahari Mahasha和Sri Guru babaji的照片 所以這裏有一些積極的存在，而不是消極的存在 是的，我很想知道關於天使的事情，Farishta 這些東西是你所說的更高的善的生命嗎？他們不是士兵，也不是什麼東西 他們是屬於不同維度的生命 他們不會變成人類，人類也不會變成天使，兩者是有區別的 地球上有很多這樣的生命，不僅是我們智人，他們滲透在這個世界上，他們也是如此 也有來自其他領域的生命，他們不屬於這個地球 不屬於這個宇宙，也不屬於這個地球 有時也來自其他宇宙。我想做克里雅，我想接觸阿特曼，獲得自由等等，但他說，在這和那之間有很多中間的東西，你爲什麼要學習這些東西，因爲它們是事實，你需要了解它們，它們存在，有時它們對我們很有幫助，你可以隨時利用它們來幫助我們。如果它們是負面的，你就學習它們，否則你如何避免它們，你如何利用它們來幫助我們，每當我們坐下來冥想和誦讀的時候，比如說[音樂]vishnu gurudeva這樣的機會，當你這樣做的時候，這些高級生命在那裏幫助我們，他們來影響我們的思想，幫助我們擺脫干擾 幫助我們擺脫雜念之類的東西 假設有一些問題發生，因爲這種事情的負面影響，總是調用積極的，這樣它就可以照顧到它的負面影響，這些高級生命爲什麼會對我們造成負面的影響，而不是高級的好生命。當我說高級的時候，我說的是不像物理的東西 是的，超越物理的東西 他們故意不會對你造成傷害 但是有一些生命，比如說可以增加你的慾望 現在這對於一個薩達克來說，在精神的道路上是一個危險的事情，所以你需要處理它的問題 你是說像性慾 是的，諸如此類 好吧，只要有大量的性活動，你就會發現這樣的生命 他們本身並不壞，但他們是那些鼓勵你繼續這樣做的人，因爲他們以它爲生，他們享受它，就像一個壞的大學朋友，確切地說，是壞的影響，但他們是好夥伴。我的意思是，他們自己沒問題，但對於我們這些走在不同方向的人來說 他們可能會帶你走 是的，抓住你了，有點調皮，沒錯，你可能都不知道，通常我們把它當作思想來看待，但我們不明白，這些思想可能是被某人灌輸的，讓我們來談談 讓我們來談談思想不是你自己的東西，沒有思想，就像我去參加一個活動，我給你舉個簡單的例子，有人在那裏講課，就像希特勒以前做的那樣，然後他就開始狂歡，最後所有的注意力都在那裏，對了，還有鼓聲和音樂聲。你的思想不再是你的了，它被佔領了，這就是我的意思，或者是環境，也許環境也可以佔領和改變你的思維，有時你可能會說，你想的東西永遠不會是你心理的一部分，它可能來自於別人或其他地方。這就是爲什麼當你坐下來冥想時，傳統上他們會畫一個保護圈，也就是一個思想圈，當然，那裏沒有任何物質，並說請遠離思想，這樣我們就可以在寺廟裏冥想了。當你看到那些站在大門口的怪異人物時，他們應該是那些遠離邪惡事物的象徵，[音樂]嗯[音樂]回到故事中來，所以嗯，你知道現在發生了什麼，我發現在播客中很容易拍攝的一些問題被刪除了，就像回到了故事中，所以有些東西在告訴我 告訴我回到故事中來 有些東西在起作用 是的，我沒有 我其實有一個和鬼有關的問題，但我想我們現在就結束這個話題 呃，在那三年裏發生了什麼，我想知道除了研究之外 你的生活是什麼樣子的，因爲我假設你是20歲 21歲 19 20 21 22年，我們不得不去村子裏乞討食物，這有一個好處，因爲巴巴吉在那個地區是有名的偉大的瑜伽師，所以無論在哪裏，甚至食物都會被提供，但我們也去了沒有食物的地方，巴巴吉可以在沒有食物的情況下堅持幾天，但他對我非常小心。但他非常關心我，他總是想方設法爲我弄到食物，並喫下這些東西，一旦你不餓，如果飢餓方面得到照顧，喜馬拉雅地區是最美麗的地方，喜馬拉雅地區是否有一些地方沒有被人類探索，我不會說沒有被人類探索，但有一些地方是不在旅遊線路上的。不在旅遊線路中，也可能不在旅遊線路中，有些人已經走了 是的，我肯定，你在那些路上看到了什麼 你看到這樣的地方，你有草藥生長，可以讓你的飢餓感保持很長時間 你看到這樣美麗的溪流，清澈的水流淌着，裏面已經注入了草藥 你有時會看到不爲人知的偉大瑜伽師，事實上在那之後我發現不爲人知的偉大瑜伽師比已知的更多，說真的，我們只知道已知的，我們認爲他們很偉大，還有不爲人知的，他們比你能想到的任何東西都要偉大，瑪哈，是否真的有某些克里雅和某些瑜伽能真正改變你的命運？是的，發生了什麼，細胞開始變化，人的細胞開始變化，它們充滿了更多的能量，而這些能量通常是人類無法獲得的，所以它們甚至在身體上也發生了變化，一個克里雅瑜伽士，不，他可能看起來和其他人差不多，但他會有一些變化，當人們見面時，他們談論這個人的一些事情時，可以發現，這很不可思議，因爲這不是一個故意的事情，當你練習克里雅時，細胞被注入能量，因此它們不再像普通細胞，我從一個稍微科學的角度理解，就是 你的呼吸變得更慢、更深 我說的對嗎？ 是的，你的呼吸變得更慢、更深，而且生命能量通常不會從被稱爲神經叢的中心釋放出來，它們也會被釋放出來，所以你的身體在這些包裏保存着能量 是的，它們被打開了 每個人都有這些能量 是的，等待着被打開 這就是爲什麼我現在要問你什麼是昆達里尼 我從來沒有在節目中問過這個問題 呃，我知道這是你年輕時感興趣的一個領域 當然也是你一生中感興趣的一個領域 但是如果有人從來沒有聽說過 我希望你能解釋一下 我避免使用 "昆達里尼 "這個詞，因爲今天它是一個非常被利用的詞，每個湯姆-迪克和哈里都在爲他的昆達里尼提高500美元，如果你去互聯網上看看，那就不是昆達里尼了，我不知道它是什麼，現在它的含義是什麼？Kundalini這個詞在密宗中被稱爲Kula Kundali 密宗有兩個部分 一個是Mantra Ana部分 它涉及到Sri Vidya等人的咒語 瑜伽密宗是那些涉及到人體能量的密宗 現在它是什麼意思 宇宙的全部能量是完整的Purna Par Shakti是Shaktas使用的詞，它是陰性的 創造性能量總是被描述爲陰性的 所以這個parashakti在人體內完成所有工作後，它首先在哪裏運行 它像性一樣運行 性和kundalini是相互關聯的，是相同的能量，但方式不同，所以kundalini 如果你不想要Shakthi，它也被稱爲Bhujangi，因爲它就像一條蛇，在這個意義上，那裏沒有蛇，但它是盤繞着的，它喚醒了他的頭蓋，也就是說，它通過性愛創造了另一個人，這是一種創造性的能量，對吧，在性愛中會發生什麼，精液進入女人的子宮，然後一個 這是由同樣的能量創造的，我們稱之爲昆達里尼，通過性行爲發揮作用，這就是爲什麼在某些地方人們把性和密宗聯繫起來，當然，這已經被利用得面目全非了，現在這種能量在製造了一個孩子之後並沒有消散，而是留在了哪裏？它停留在脊柱底部的中心，叫做穆拉達拉（Muladhara），你的中心最低，不是指低和高，而是在最底層，是的，身體上很低，所以它停留在那裏，每當一個人有性興奮或享受時，都是同樣的能量在運作。瑜伽師所做的是不允許它在性領域表現得太多，而是控制它，把它轉過來，讓它上升到脊柱，當它上升到脊柱時，昆達里尼或Shakti或任何你想稱爲Bhujangi的東西就變成了一種精神上的創造性能量，就像它變成一種身體上的創造性能量一樣。通過性愛，你如何讓它轉過來 克里亞是其中一種做法，目的是讓它轉過來 從瑜伽密宗的角度來看，還有另一種密宗，叫做咒語 一些聲音被用來喚醒它，但最好的辦法是將兩者明智地結合起來，如果你有紀律性，需要相當多的時間。
   這是個很難回答的問題，因爲這完全取決於你的成長階段，以及你過去的經歷，取決於這些因素，但我認爲，因此你不能以這種方式固定一個合理的時間，但我認爲勤奮的練習，瞭解你需要超越平凡，可以幫助你去那裏，但這很難固定。有些人發生得很快，有些人則需要一些時間，我的想法是不要放棄，因爲它會延續到你的下一本書中，是的，而且我覺得它最好是慢慢發展和成熟，而不是突然發生，因爲能量是如此強大，有些情況下，它突然發生，身體和心靈無法應對，人們變得有些半 當你說到瘋狂的時候，會突然出現一股能量，他們不知道如何安置，如何控制，他們會有奇怪的行爲，也許有些人可能認爲他們被附身了，是的，可能是壞的，他們實際上並沒有瘋，他們看到了一些東西，聽到了一些東西，並且在他們身上發生了一些事情，所以我認爲最好的事情是，它以緩慢的速度發生，直到整個心靈和身體變得成熟，能夠承受喚醒的影響，這就是爲什麼我非常擔心，當人們在沒有爲人做好準備的情況下就給他們提供技術，我非常擔心。我非常擔心，因爲我收到人們在郵件和電子郵件上寫給我的信，說我去找某某某，他教我這個，現在發生了什麼，我的整個身體都在顫抖，有東西在我的脊柱上，我不能喫喝，我很痛苦，請幫助我，現在我總是告訴他們，你必須 回到那個人那裏，問他你學到了什麼，你教了什麼，他應該能夠幫助你，然後他們說他聯繫不上，如果他聯繫不上，那麼你是什麼樣的老師，你知道我想做什麼，你需要一個穩定的 呃，有經驗的大師來教你這些東西 你需要一個穩定的 你需要一個穩定的人教你這些東西 第二，你應該堅持下去，如果你教了別人什麼，因爲這是個未知的領域，你不知道哪裏有陷阱，這個可憐的傢伙不知道，所以你需要這樣做，所以我做了，我非常小心，我一般不輕易給人。不是因爲我爲了他們的利益而隱藏它 那麼你的昆達里尼上升和你的開悟是一樣的嗎？ 是一樣的 阿摩克或涅槃是兩件不同的事情嗎？ 根據瑜伽經文，一般來說，當能量上升並進入大乘期時，就會發生Kyolya或Moksha 然而，我覺得而且我知道，有些人沒有練習克里雅瑜伽或沒有練習昆達里尼瑜伽，但他們也獲得了光明，但這是在他們沒有自覺努力的情況下發生的，因爲他們的心靈已經變得非常純淨。在許多生命中，他們一直在努力實現它，他們不需要經歷這個過程，但它已經在一些中心覺醒了，它可能沒有經過通常的瑜伽師課程，從穆拉達拉到薩哈斯拉，有一種情況是，他的能量突然在心臟中心打開了。他們突然覺得所有的幸福、感覺、能量和思想以及注意力都來到了例如他們心中的Anahat，我們的心中有大量的橋樑，他們不知道任何關於穆拉的事情，它突然就來了。也有這樣的情況，他們沒有系統地做過克里雅，但他們通過問一些問題找到了自己的真實身份，比如我是誰，我是這個身體還是別的什麼，然後它就會發生，所以我是誰，我是這個身體，好吧，我在開玩笑，這是一個笑話，你知道我是誰嗎？這是一個非常有趣的事情，因爲有一個偉大的Ravana Maharshi 是的，他發現... ...你必須記住，在14歲的時候，他已經有了精神體驗 我們說他沒有做任何sadhana，但他一定在以前的生活中做過sadhana 他生來就是一個浪蕩子 在14歲的時候，他有一個經驗，他看到他不是身體，他與身體是分開的，所以他說如果我與身體分開，那麼我到底是誰，我是這個身體還是思想還是什麼，他達到了你不能否認的，我完全不能否認拉瑪納的武功達到了最高境界 我不能否認Ramana在沒有經歷任何昆達里尼的情況下就達到了最高境界 但是人們不看他的前世 我沒有 我沒有看過他的前世 但是不要看那個概念 他一定是在爲它而努力 在這麼年輕的時候他就有了經驗 然後他所有的修行都是爲了加強 三四年來，他只是控制了它 拉瑪納・馬哈希是這樣，但不是每個人都是這樣 如果有人坐下來一直說我是誰，我是誰，我是誰 你認爲一個人可以找到真理嗎？ 我的意思是，這是一個頌歌，沒有任何意義，只是一個重複 是不是真的，如果你心裏對大師有真正的、不加過濾的渴望，大師就會來找你，對我來說，我只能說我自己是百分之百的，因爲我想要一個老師，老師就會來找我，他們說當學生準備好了，老師就會出現，但學生也需要想要 是的，如果你在一個地方，你說如果我沒有得到一個適當的指導，我就會......我就會死，肯定會有一個老師，但它必須是非常真誠的，一個指向這個的老師也可以離開 是的，如果他的功能結束了，他可以離開，你認爲大師會在你的生命過程中改變。你認爲大師會在你的一生中改變，你可以改變你，這沒有什麼壞處，如果有人說，哦，你不應該離開我，抓緊我，這對我來說沒有意義，除非你想去某個地方，請去，只要它有幫助，我也不反對指導別人去別的地方 好吧，在節目的早期，我們談到了維度 嗯，我理解的一件事是關於溼婆這個詞，而不是溼婆神，溼婆被稱爲超越人類理解的維度，我想問問你這是什麼意思，因爲它超越了我的理解，比如什麼 外面的維度是什麼？ 有三個維度，xyz，第四個維度是時間，這就是我的想法，因爲科學還沒有理解時間，時間只是數學方程中的一種便利，對嗎？ 我問過一些非常聰明的天體物理學家，向他們致敬。但我問過一些非常聰明的天體物理學家 甚至他們也沒能真正理解時間的含義 不，他們不知道，沒人知道什麼是時間 也許讓我們從這裏開始，所以讓我們開始談論時間 然後你可以把它撥高，帶我們到第五和第六個損害，讓 我先說說關於尺寸的事情 好的，不管你想在哪裏，溼婆這個詞 你知道溼婆是一個非常抽象的概念 它不是我們放在某人閉着眼睛坐着的圖片裏的那個溼婆 但即使在那個圖片裏，它也是瑜伽士的象徵 因此，只有瑜伽士才能理解希瓦姆這個詞的含義 在希瓦的圖中，你總是看到第三隻眼睛，這是什麼意思？第三隻眼 這裏什麼都沒有，這是象徵性的 這意味着以我們現在的感覺器官，也就是我們的感知工具 你無法發現任何超越第三維度的東西 所以只有當這些器官發揮作用的時候 當你的其他感官知覺打開的時候，這些知覺是超越常規的 只有你才能開始瞭解下一個維度是怎麼回事 因此，溼婆有時也被描述爲半男半女，這是什麼意思？ 這意味着Shakti是能量，Shivam是最終的寧靜狀態，不是兩種不同的東西，而是同一種東西的兩面。沒有創造，沒有運動，只有當有運動時，整個事情纔會發生，那一刻就是shakti，所以我對你的問題想說的是，除非我們喚醒我們系統中的其他感知工具，否則我們只能理論化地看待那件事。你告訴我關於螞蟻的事情是個很好的例子，讓我再給你舉個例子，有一個塑料的透明盒子，它被垂直分割，頂部是開放的，被另一面透明的牆垂直分割，這邊有小塊的紅色生命，我們說這邊有小塊的綠色生命，他們只知道兩個維度，就是這邊或者這邊，他們很瘦，甚至不知道有任何厚度。他們非常想去那裏，但他們不能去，因爲他們不知道怎麼去，中間有一堵牆，他們的頭腦中沒有出現這樣的概念，他們只在那個維度，但他們看到有些人已經到達那裏，他們是怎麼到達的，我們也想去。所以他們試圖移動，移動，按壓，按壓，其中一些人意識到這是行不通的，所以他們安靜地坐在一個角落裏，這時有人把他們抱起來，放在這邊，當他們移動時，你甚至不能把他們抱起來，我不知道，所以我想說的就是 所以我想說的是，要想到達那個你無法到達的維度，因爲你不習慣超越三維空間的東西，一個辦法就是安靜地坐着，靜靜地冥想，當靜止發生時，你就會被從某個普通的維度提升到另一個維度，因爲這不是線性的，就像真理在那裏，或者某個東西在那裏，另一個維度在那裏，我在這裏，我想到達那裏，這不是那樣的，因爲它在這裏，在那裏，在任何地方，所以我如何通過不接觸任何地方而體驗，一切安靜，呆在你的地方，努力使你的
   是的，在一個更高的地方，這將使我們慢慢地理解，至少在頭腦中開始理解一些超越三維空間的東西，什麼是時間，所以50年前發生的事情現在也在發生，時間是基於變化的，我不是在談論物理學的觀點，實際的觀點，時間取決於變化，如果沒有變化，你不能計算時間，一切都一樣，沒有時間。如果這個談話很無聊的話，人們會想這是什麼時候結束的，這麼長的時間一直在進行，這可能是相同的機械時間，假設它很有趣，當它結束的時候，我會說，哦，我的上帝，它結束了，這是非常短的，所以時間只是一個物理的東西，或者它也是心理的，再加上生物，比如說蚊子，我們說它活兩天，但對蚊子來說不是兩天，這個蚊子出生後變成像蟲子一樣，然後它脫落了 它的尾巴長出來了，變成了蚊子 然後它尋找食物，喝我們的血或者誰的血 然後它繁衍後代，有一個家庭，等等 然後它兩天後就死了 兩天或者三天 我不知道我們的壽命是多少，對蚊子來說是兩天，三天 相信我，那是整個生命，現在的時間是什麼？ 這是時間，這一切 所以用物理方式衡量時間是一件事，實際上時間是另一件事 所以它和你的心理和思想非常相關 它的目的是什麼？ 爲什麼上帝要把這個元素放在這裏？ 就像說什麼是重力，爲什麼它在那裏？ 你只能接受它，你甚至不能試圖找到它的理由 如果時間是第四維度，第五維度是什麼？ 下一個維度是什麼？ 我相信我們會畢業的 我沒有想過這個問題，但我認爲時間不是下一個維度，超越時間纔是下一個維度 我們來談談這個問題 當我說超越時間時，首先在理論上接受時間是一個心理因素 你怎麼去超越？超越它是什麼意思呢？你是說凍結時間，不理解時間，通過理解理解什麼是時間，那麼時間就會消失，你就會明白我們通過時鐘知道的這個時間並不是真正的時間，我們認爲這個生命就是出生和死亡，我們出生，我們死亡，但是我知道很多瑜伽士也肯定地知道，這不是我們生命的開始也不是結束，它從一開始就在進行，甚至沒有人知道起源，實際上沒有人甚至瑜伽士都不知道 但它一直在繼續，直到我們停止它，直到我們停止它 是的，當我們意識到這是無止境的，是無用的 我們不想一直來，說好吧，抓緊時間 然後只有你能阻止別人，你不能阻止它 你認爲人類的未來是什麼 我認爲人類必須進一步進化 它仍然來到了一個點，我們認爲他們處於進化的最高水平 現在人工智能通過我認爲我們仍然處於 我認爲我們還處在你所說的大腦的這個葉子裏，即文明的額葉，我們需要超越它，人類不能只是站在這裏，它需要進一步發展，說到大腦，讓我們談談松果體，那麼西方人所理解的第三隻眼，首先是第三隻眼，我們頭腦中的能力是否因爲松果體而得到釋放，我不知道你是否熟悉Dmt，我很想聽聽你對這些概念的看法，因爲這就是西方人的理解 如果你聽說過死藤水，我很想知道你的想法，所以我個人會讓我從這個開始，不欣賞任何人被死藤水或任何這類東西困住，因爲暫時是的，它讓你明白有一些東西是不爲普通人所知的，是的，但這就是它的終點，如果你需要發展，你需要發展你的腦細胞到那個水平，這意味着你需要做其他練習，包括克里雅，當然現在就松果體而言，我 我知道有很多人都在談論松果體，現在松果體的一個教會是精神器官，讓我這樣說吧，直到60-70年前，松果體被認爲是一個殘存的器官闌尾，後來人們發現，它有一個非常重要的功能，生物學家稱之爲晝夜節律，睡眠和覺醒搜索，這是視頻，當一切都很黑暗，有好的音樂，松果體注入一點點褪黑激素到我們的血液中 我們感覺很好，當我們說我們處於良好的冥想深度時，這意味着一些激素被注入到血液中，Dmt或其他一些激素，我不記得名字了，所以我們感覺很好，所以這也是相當化學的內容，現在通過瑜伽，你可以有意識地讓它發生，這是所有的時間 是的，這是故事的一面，現在如果松果體或褪黑激素，當你有時差時，醫生要求你服用褪黑激素，這是松果體產生的同樣的東西，現在如果它真的，如果它是一個 在吠陀經中，人類的意識狀態被描述爲清醒狀態、夢境狀態、深度睡眠和被稱爲Turiya的其他狀態，深度睡眠是最後一個被討論和描述的狀態，因爲Turiyas不能被定義，松果體和褪黑激素與Sushubti或深度睡眠有關，深度睡眠和Turia之間的界限非常小。和Sushupti或深度睡眠的區別是，在Sushupti中，一個人在外面沒有認識，在裏面也沒有認識，但他顯然處於巨大的幸福之中，因爲沒有人想從深度睡眠中醒來，因爲我們在享受，但當我們在享受深度睡眠時，我們沒有意識到它，只有當我們醒來時，我們才覺得啊，那是一個多麼幸福的睡眠，但如果你現在感覺它，記住它，這意味着有人確實在經歷那個幸福，所以在那個深度睡眠狀態，如果有人能實踐泡沫，不可能，但理論上它可以 那麼從深層開始，一個人就進入了Turiyah，那是一種無處不在的幸福狀態，每個人都想得到神，如果你願意，你可以稱之爲神的海洋，意識和幸福的海洋 好的，所以注意力和刑罰腺之間的細線，以及對它周圍區域的冥想，可以把我們從深度睡眠帶入Turya，這就是它變得重要的地方 我也認爲它可以被思想控制，你是什麼意思？儘管它是一個深藏在大腦中的器官，但它可以通過思想來增加或減少其釋放的激素水平，使其進入腦流，進入血液，通過視覺化視覺化注意一個點，使思想平靜，使呼吸平衡 最早提到克里雅的是《吉他》中的第六章，它被稱爲瑜伽，克里希納說阿朱納坐直，保持脊柱和頭部穩定，把你的注意力放在眉毛之間的另一箇中心，這是把你帶到裏面去的原因。然後平衡你的呼吸 說："克里雅和自由" 這是一個簡單的冥想，你剛剛給了它 不，不，說真的，這是來自《吉他》的 克里希納很好地描述了它 他說，坐穩，保持你的脊柱穩定 頭部穩定，頸部穩定 好了，現在把你的注意力放在釀酒上 你的注意力集中在醞釀中的Mateya，平衡你的呼吸，走出去，自由地達到Kaio這個詞，所以我認爲我們開始這個播客是基於你的故事，我們已經走得很遠了，但我喜歡這樣的播客，這是播客的真正樂趣所在。有一個特別的話題，人們最近在互聯網上非常傾向於雪人，呃，在我們製作的每一個關於雪人的視頻下，都會出現你的名字，是的，爲什麼會這樣，只是因爲我碰巧提到，當我想去喀喇崑崙山的時候，這是一個不成功的嘗試，Bhavaji說好吧，Cello，所以我們沒有去通常的路線，任何現在正在使用的路線，道路是完全不同的，現在沒有人去通過那條路線，我們通過印度，西藏的邊界進入喀喇崑崙山。 我們穿過印度和西藏的邊界，進入Kakabushindi，然後越過邊界，我們來到一個村莊，那裏有一尊西藏菩薩，它非常巨大，它的頭在屋頂上，在那裏我們停下來過夜，我不能這樣做，因爲我發了高燒，我的體溫上升，我處於神志不清的狀態，等等。我醒了，我醒了，因爲我突然發現我的體溫下降了，我感覺稍微好了一點，我在想我在哪裏，我甚至忘了我說我在哪裏，Babaji在哪裏，不知所蹤，我躺在帳篷裏，唯一的燈是他們裏面的煤油燈，然後我突然想到有人，我以爲是那個給我送湯的尼泊爾人，或者其他什麼人，有人進來了，我很喫驚。我沒有任何妄想症，有一個巨大的人站在那裏，藉着燈籠的光亮，我幾乎看不到什麼，但我知道那是一個毛茸茸的人，第一個懷疑是熊，但不是，它像人一樣站着，我看不清它的特徵，但它走近我，發出一種非常陰森的聲音，就像我不知道怎麼說，就像哨子，但它不是，我不知道那種，不，它實際上是 然後它拿了個東西塞到我嘴裏，把東西塞到我嘴裏，是個苦東西，我吐不出來，就吞下去了，等Badur跑進來的時候，它就跑了，這個我在自傳裏提到過，這就是爲什麼城市的東西會出現，後來我甚至以爲它是某種喜馬拉雅猩猩之類的，後來Babaji告訴我，它是個80號，他說你
   我說我已經康復了，他說不，它還會再來八天，這是一種山地熱，通常會在最後把人帶走，他說這一點，他說他們是好人，他們不是人們所想的那樣，害怕，他帶來了一種草藥，把它塞進你的嘴裏，否則你就會死，第三天我們回來了，你還記得那張臉嗎，你知道那是黑暗，只有颶風 我不能確切地看到那張臉，但我可以告訴你，它比人的臉更寬更大，這一點我可以告訴你，你有沒有害怕，我當然害怕，我想我不能尖叫，因爲我太害怕了，我的聲音卡在我的喉嚨裏，我甚至不能尖叫，但在此之前，這一切都是瞬間完成的，你從它身上感受到什麼能量，我沒有任何感覺，我想我聞到了一些東西，比如說 一些毛茸茸的動物，比如狗，靠近那種氣味，除此之外，我沒有感覺到，你認爲雪人的目的是什麼，Babaji說他是來幫助你的，除此之外，我不知道，一般來說，我喜歡雪人，爲什麼你認爲他們在那裏，我不知道，我甚至沒有想過這個問題，因爲這是我第一次也是最後一次有這樣的經歷，但從這一點我瞭解到，在偏遠地區的山洞和森林裏有這樣的生物。我們不相信，因爲我們不經常看到它們 是的，人們低估了山和森林有多大 我們不知道任何事情，沒有任何東西可以與我們的國家森林相比 有許多未知的地方 [音樂] 雖然我確實希望問你關於你的生活方式的其他一切 我知道我們的時間有點緊張，這就是爲什麼我將帶來一個問題由 我的叔叔 他讀過你所有的書，我說，你知道這是你真正希望我提出來的，作爲蝦米對觀衆的一個很好的介紹 他說，呃，我很想知道更多一點關於Nagas的事情，你知道他們是什麼，他們是誰，他們的目的是什麼 呃，這是一些我很不願意打開的章節，但是我們今天的Nagas，我說的是帶帽的蛇，不是不帶帽的 蛇眼鏡蛇，我們有的帶帽眼鏡蛇，特別是有剪刀標記的傢伙，我不知道該用什麼詞，很久以前，他們屬於一個物種，生活在另一個領域，在古代，他們是我們的老師，他們教我們很多東西，納迦，這就是爲什麼納迦被當作智慧的象徵來崇拜，甚至昆達里尼也被認爲是納迦[音樂]，我們今天有一個完全不同的，呃，什麼？你怎麼稱呼它？ 有一個詞可以形容它 對不起，我不是說縮小的版本，不是縮小的 你知道的，就像頹廢的頹廢這個詞 我在找一個頹廢的頹廢的荷蘭物種的遺留物，我們今天有 因爲其他納迦都消失了，他們都回界了 他們變得不透明的原因是他們開始和人類發生關係 所以他們被召回了，那些被留下的人就是這樣 我們今天看到的蛇類眼鏡蛇 你認爲眼鏡蛇的智力是否超出了我們所知道的範圍？ 我們今天的眼鏡蛇並不像它們的祖先那樣聰明，它們是我們的老師 但它們絕對比我們認爲的普通蛇更聰明，比如說無尾蛇 現在這是有爭議的，如果我說這個，生物學家說這不是真的 是的，但我們知道，眼鏡蛇有一點我可以告訴你 我的理解是，眼鏡蛇不會咬人，除非它們認爲自己受到了威脅 現在聽音樂和搖晃是不真實的，因爲眼鏡蛇聽不到，它們只接收地面的振動，它們聽不到，它們沒有耳朵，但它們能感覺到節奏 好了，我還注意到一件事，眼鏡蛇能認出昆達利尼正在活動的人 你是否願意只談論祖先去了哪裏？在他們的領域裏，Nagaloka就是他們回去的地方，我曾遇到過一個人，我真的在Dharun看到過那裏的人，他來過，但他們很少回來看望我，這是一個非常罕見的例子，他們一般不會回來。我很高興，我告訴巴巴，我不想去，也不想陷進去，他說不，你的人生計劃是教書，是回去結婚，安定下來教書，因爲我想讓你知道普通人經歷了什麼，沒有這些，你就不能教書，所以你必須經歷這些，回去吧，他還告訴我，在我得到他的綠色信號之前，不要教書。直到42歲都沒有教過一個字，但你當然在練習你的創作，而且每天都在擴展你的思想，你在那些年裏也學到了更多的東西。你這輩子的目的就是轉達你所獲得的信息 你這輩子的目的就是讓人們明白，在每個生命體中，尤其是在人類中，因爲人類可以識別它，而其他生命體則不能，所有的生命體中都有一個神聖的元素，所有的人類中，神聖的元素是我們生命的本質，如果你把我們的思想轉過來看看，如果你發現它，這就是人生的目的，把人從普通人帶到超越的地方，這就是我的人生目的，所以呃，謝謝你的談話。我想我們的談話已經結束了 所以我真心希望能和你有更多的談話 因爲我和你相處得很融洽 所以我們會看到一些時間 我們可以 我希望我沒有讓你感到不舒服 在任何情況下我都不會感到不舒服 但我發現了一些東西 好的，沒有問題 謝謝你，先生 在我讓你離開之前還有一個問題 就是對我個人有什麼建議嗎 繼續你正在做的事情 因爲當你和來自不同生活領域的人進行討論時... ...各種各樣的人... ...但當你這樣做時，請記住... ...精神方面是生活中非常重要的一部分... ...當它從像你這樣的年輕人身上流傳開來時，其他年輕人會對它感興趣並嘗試... ...因爲生活的最終目的是爲了擴展精神... ...所以當你可能在做其他事情時，要一直保持這部分的工作。因爲你會變得越來越有名，我知道，當它變得越來越大的時候，它就會膨脹，不要錯過它的精神部分，Sri，我很感謝你，嗯，我不知道該說什麼，只能說謝謝你，謝謝你把它從我嘴裏說出來，因爲我一般有時候很不願意討論，謝謝你以一種非常友好的方式把它說出來，我是說，我只是希望觀衆能認真聽完這一集，我希望你能重新聽。 因爲即使在說話的句子之間，也有很多信息和信息，所以謝謝你，我希望歡迎你回到節目中來，非常感謝你，當我們開始錄製這個播客時，我以爲我會在一集裏涵蓋這個人的整個人生旅程，我錯了，我只涵蓋了他的起源故事，可能是第二章，他遇到了他的大師，通常在序言中，我談到了播客讓我感覺在這個序言中，我只是想歡迎Sharia，因爲我們需要聽到更多關於這個故事，我們需要從Shariam那裏瞭解更多。我們需要從沙里亞姆那裏學到更多的東西，我們需要隨着目前世界上所有這些知識的興起而興起，他們說印度是文化的中心，精神的中心，甚至當我們談論整個世界時，我的意思是，當涉及到精神成長，涉及到哲學，涉及到生命的深層意義時，整個世界都轉向印度，我希望這個播客幫助你找到生命的略微深層意義，與你的朋友分享它。 但真正的知識是知道我們什麼都不知道，並牢記這一點，當然，我要請你在Spotify上關注我們，每集都在世界其他地方48小時前在Spotify上提供。很快，我迫不及待地想錄制一個續集，在描述框中，我已經鏈接了Shreem的書，請確保你檢查它們，這個人寫的一些章節將完全扭曲你對現實的看法，我認爲互聯網剛剛開始瞭解我們這個時代的傳奇，這是Shariyam在Ranveer的節目中[音樂] Mahavatar Babaji
