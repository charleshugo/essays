Sometimes you find a person who maybe is 30-40 involved in things which you don't like. Terrible things. Then one day he wakes up and he realizes, ah, this is not my purpose. And he goes back. Why? Because as Krishna says in the Gita to Arjuna, whatever spiritual sadhana you do, it's there like a bank balance to you, however many lives you come. He said, look, I can do this, this, this. So, Babaji was smiling. He said, "sun le kuch mat bolna." He said, listen, don't say anything. Then he said, look here, my hands are here. He showed like this. My hands are here. Look, look here. So he said, here, like this. Then he did like this. Then he produced one Rudraksha. And he said, this I-- Then he said, where did this come from? I can give it to you. It won't disappear. You can keep it forever. Put it in your neck. Do you want to put it in your neck? No. Afterwards. Like this, what you have. Oh, my God. If you want, then I will make a hole for you. I just got to give the listeners some context. Can I give a hole in this so that you can use it? Yes, sir. Put a string. -Yeah. -My God. Okay. -This is on camera? -I don't know. It got captured on camera-- For the audio listeners, on camera, we just-- A Rudraksha got created out of thin air. It smells very nice. You want to check? Throughout the journey of The Ranveer Show, we've had some extremely epic moments, but none as epic as a Himalayan Master, Sri M manifesting a Rudraksha out of thin air live on the show. This moment stayed with my team. We've been discussing it since the day we recorded this podcast. But honestly, every time we speak to Sri M, he gives us some of the most epic content. I believe his last episode with us is the highest viewed TRS episode ever. I highly recommend that you go check it out to understand the story of this man. Because this episode is more philosophy centric, more thought centric, and I'd even say deeper and more spiritually fulfilling. If you're someone who loves the spiritual episodes of TRS, this episode with Sri M is going to be extremely memorable for you. For more episodes just like this, make sure you follow us on Spotify. Every episode is available on Spotify 48 hours before it's available anywhere else in the world. Because we're a Spotify exclusive. Before I let you slip into this one, I will remind you that my meditation app Level SuperMind is now live on the App Store and the Play Store. Make sure you download it. Make sure you use it. Especially if you wish to begin or enhance your meditation process. An epic episode of Sri M with yours truly is now beginning. 🎶[Music]🎶 🎶[Music]🎶 🎶[Music]🎶 Sri M, sir. Welcome back to The Ranveer Show. Thank you. Namashkar. How are you, sir? I'm good, very good. Last time's episode was beyond epic. It was so epic. It was so many learnings, so many stories. Audiences kind of call it one of their favorite episodes of all time. -That's nice to hear.-Yeah. We clocked in a huge number of views because of all your experiences. It's also because of questions, proper questions. I'm glad, sir. Honored to be doing this with you again, honestly. Thank you. Has anything changed in your life since the last time we spoke? Yes, that I've become more and more busier. -I mean, that's what has changed. -Okay. Maybe I got fed up of shaving these days. Beyond that no much change. I am too busy. I think the beard is looking cool. Thank you. It's a bit of a cricketer vibe on you. Okay, so the last time, the way we did the podcast was we did your story from your childhood -up to maybe the age of 19 or 20. -Yeah. And it was just in those 20 years that we extracted so many stories -and so much information. -Yeah. There are two ways in which I want to take this podcast. -One is a continuation of the last time. -Okay. But two, honestly, are a lot of my own questions because after a very long time, -we're doing a spiritual conversation. -Sure, sure. So I think, we'll just begin from there, sir. Okay. There was a long period in your life where you took up -very serious sadhana with your guru. -Yes. And I think that's about the point -where we left off from the last time. -Yeah. So I would like for you to begin there. Maybe let's actually begin with a very simple question, which is the concept of a guru. I think a lot of young spiritual seekers don't even understand how important that is. And that's the one lesson I have gained through the show, that you might gain spiritual knowledge through the Internet, through Google, but it can be dangerous. So, two questions. What's a guru? Second is, why can it be dangerous if you do it without a guru? Right. So to answer your second question first, it's not actually dangerous in that sense of the term, but you might wander around quite a bit without going on the right track. That itself, from the spiritual point of view, is a waste of time, if you don't have a proper teacher, you might wander around in your own ways, good to learn. But then without proper direction, by the time you look back, you might have spent a lot of time not being able to do anything substantial. This problem is there. By wandering around, do you mean different paths? Not different paths. Not only different paths. Look, if you go into the Internet, you see various teachers, various teachings, and then you don't know how to choose? What to do? So you do little bit here, you do little bit there. You do little-- There is no full attention one point at sadhana going on, you see, whatever path you choose. So therefore, one wastes a lot of time. In my case, I was lucky that even though I met many relig-- yogis and spiritual people, I found Maheshwarnath Babaji and I kind of accepted him as my teacher. So it was a little better for me because I was properly guided. If I had doubts, I could ask him. Sometimes if I did something wrong, I would be, in a way, I would say, punished. And when I did something good, there would be some appreciation. And here was a treasure house of experience and knowledge from whom I derived a lot of goodness from there. Okay. So this is why it may be better. Of course, there are many parts. The problem is that what we are searching for generally spiritually, I'm saying purely spiritually, not good health, good mind. All this is part of your practice of yoga and meditation. But suppose one is looking higher horizon and you're looking for purely spiritual, then it's so vast and infinite that one can't say that this is the only way to it. I don't say. I always say Kriya Yoga is my parampara, my tradition. But Babaji himself used to ask, what Kriya did Mirabai do? You'll have to give some context on who Mirabai is to the listener. Now, Mirabai, India, many people know that Mirabai was a princess, a queen of some kingdom in Rajasthan or somewhere, I don't know, Gujarat, I'm not sure. Now, she was a Krishna bhakta. All the time, she was worshiping her Krishna and wanted to have a Darshan actual meeting with Krishna. She didn't have any knowledge of scriptures. She didn't have any such thing. And yet she's supposed to have been highly spiritual and had many Darshans of the deity of the infinite, whom she worshipped as Krishna. She did not practice any Pranayama, did not do any yoga. She didn't know any of these things. But she did get there, and she was such an important person that a great yogi like Ramananda, when he, you know, he used to not meet women. He used to keep himself shut, and he would meet one by one people. And if women go, he would say, I don't want to meet them because they're a distraction for the yogi. Yeah. So Mirabai went there to meet him. He said, I don't want to. Somebody said this is Mirabai. He said, no, I still don't want to see her. So Mirabai sent him a note. She said, you don't want to see women? From my point of view, there's only one man, Krishna. All you are women. Which one… So he said, bring her in. So such a person did not do any Kriya yoga or anything of that kind. No Pranayama. No nothing. I'm not saying it's my Parampara, I'll defend it with all my might. But yeah. And Ramana Maharshi on the other side, he was in Jnani. I mean, one who sought the truth through inquiry. -Jnana yoga. -Okay, by questioning? Questioning, trying to find out for himself. What is his true identity? Who he was? His only one formula he put, He said Deham Naham Koham Soham which means I am not the body. Then who am I? I am that Soham. Soham means it's not just a mantra. Soham means that I am. Soham! So, Babaji always used to ask, don't think that everybody has to do Kriya. There are some people who are yogically inclined. For them, Kriya is good. But even Kriya will become a mechanical exercise. If you don't have that serious inquiry in trying to find out your true identity. And also you don't have a little bit of devotion in your heart, it becomes a mechanical practice. Like Kabir Das used to say, Jadhad Prem Na Sanchare, Sodhad Jan Smashan. Jaise Khaal Lohar Ki, Saans Let Bin Praan. Which means if there is no devotion, love, etc. in the heart, it's as good as a smashan, as a cremation ground. He said even the bellows of a blacksmith, you know those old type bellows with blacksmith, they also breathe but they don't have life. See, so, even Kriya should not become a mechanical process. They should be earning for moving forward. There should be an amount of bhakti. I would call it heart in it and so on. So this is why, why I'm saying all this is because I had a teacher who taught me all this properly. Therefore, I think it's in a way, even if you spend some time trying to explore what is my path, finally, it's good idea to click on to someone and go on practicing. If you keep digging bore wells everywhere 10 feet, then dig another, you won't get water. One place, go deep. You might get something out there. Okay, the reason I'm bringing up this question is because it's been a very active question over the last two weeks. We've had some very incredible celebrities on the show and all of them seem to have achieved a certain degree of self-actualization. There was Virender Sehwag, Sara Ali Khan, Manoj Bajpai and a few more people. And everyone highlighted how important destiny has been in their own journeys. And of course, I know that destiny plays a role. But it was weird how all these 6-7 podcasts we did, everyone brought up destiny and how they're an outcome of circumstance and circumstance is something I've been thinking about a lot as well. I feel even this podcast happens because the relationship I share with my mother is a very podcasting relationship. Since I was a little kid. Always had deep conversations, stories from both sides. That's why I enjoy this job. Those were my circumstances. Do you believe that destiny is a very important factor in a spiritual journey as well? Like, everyone has their own timelines and whoever's actually meant to fall into this path will fall into their path. I do believe that there is some kind of a plan, of course, which you might call destiny. But also, there are many people who get this plan -but who are not able to move forward. -Really? Because they're not putting in enough effort into it. So I also give equal importance to effort. We have passed through maybe 200 million years of genetic evolution, right? So there is a lot of mixing and remixing of genetics. So every person you see, is a mixture of 2 million years, so some parts of our brain are already wired because of the genes, right? We cannot deny that. Even if you don't want to believe in past birth, but you still are wired in some way. 200 million years. Not even two births or three births. Genetic evolution. Now, given that we are also given opportunities and openings to work, and when that opportunity comes, we need to take advantage of the opportunity, then it works, of course. If it doesn't work, one thing about understanding is that, well, it hasn't worked probably because, I didn't put in enough work, or maybe I'm not destined. So let me change and look at some other way. Two ways of looking at it. I'm saying for the youngsters especially you just now mentioned, many people were young people. So while, yes, they appreciated that they were destined in some way, but they put in a lot of hard work. Virender Sehwag could not have reached there without batting or bowling. I don't know what he does, for hours together. There may be, I must tell you this, I went to Hong Kong some years ago. There was a guy called Harilela. He is still there, I think. he must have been at that time, 92 years old, little bit on the fat side, but very active and so on. So he invited me for lunch in his own hotel. So he told me this life is like snakes and ladders. I said, why do you say that? He said, because-- He also holds the franchise for all the-- -What is that? Holiday Inns. -Oh Holiday Inn. Throughout South Asia. -Okay. -Big man. Hindi man. So he told me, it's snakes. I said, why do you say that? He said, sometimes you're up and sometimes you're down. And the guy, when he is down, thinks I should go up is the fellow who rises finally. But then he said, luck. He called it luck, for destiny, also plays its part. He said he started his career in Hong Kong as a tailor who could make suits overnight. Means, you order in the morning, you get your delivery in the evening. And there were a lot of Westerners at that time, that point in Hong Kong he started at that time, he said, many of my friends also were in the same business. They were also doing the same. I came up, they didn't, I can't explain this. Call it luck, call it destiny. But he said I worked very hard. If I had not worked hard, I could not have come up. But there were others also working hard who didn't come up. So you have to have a balance between these two things. -You can't simply say destiny and sleep. -Okay. When your opportunity comes, and the blueprint is ready, -you should start working. -Okay. In order to understand this concept of opportunity coming your way, the one thing I have to ask you now is the story again, I think something we didn't touch upon the last time was your time before you were born in this body. And I know it's something you've spoken about in your books. And there were a lot of readers of your books who had checked out the podcast. And if you go through our comment section on that episode, a lot of people have requested for this question. Yeah. So I wrote a book after the autobiography. -It's called, "The Journey Continues." -Okay. In which I have stated a few of my past life experiences. So I have not been able to put together many, but those who I could put together in some way, these I have written about my past life. There you will see that even this, me sitting here, attained a certain level of spiritual understanding, fully, only in this life. I have worked so hard in many lives. Even though I had a teacher coming, -Babaji was following me for many lives. -Really. Rather, I was following him for many lives. My first experience takes me, what I remember, takes me back to even the time of Krishna's time. And after that, as one of the founders of the ruling family of Jaisalmer, even before Jaisal. All these places, there was some instructor for me. There was a teacher. From Jaisalmer, Babaji came into the picture, and in fact, it was he who designed the coat of arms for the Jaisalmer Royal Family. And then after a great deal of war, he said, now put an end to it. Now go into your spiritual path fully. This is the beginning. So, what I can say-- What you can draw from this is that one starts very early and works hard. Many lives you may take to come to a point where this is the last life where you attain your spiritual understanding. So to say that some people got it young, some people, even till they're dead, they're not able to find it. Those who got it young are those who have already gone through it in a great way many times. And this life, they're completing their sadhana. What is young? Some people at the age of eight, for instance, Babaji visited me out of the blue, people would think. But no, it is a link to the past. Who is that? Ramana Maharshi at the age of 14, he got this experience suddenly that he was separated from his body. He didn't do any sadhana before that. He had no teacher, nothing, nothing that we know of. And he felt that he was out of his body. And then he saw his body lying there, and he said to himself, if I'm not the body because I can see it lying there, then who am I? That's where his inquiry started. So how did he get there at 14? There are many people who go 14 years of age, nothing happens to them. There's something in the past. When I say young, I mean quite early in life. -That's what I meant. -Okay. And one more thing, since we are saying this, you never know who has reached where in this life until something clicks. Sometimes you find a person who maybe is 30-40 involved in things which you don't like. Terrible things. Then one day he wakes up and he realizes, ah, this is not my purpose. And he goes back. Why? Because as Krishna says in the Gita to Arjuna, whatever spiritual sadhana you do, it's there like a bank balance to you, however, many lives you come. It's there. You don't have to start at square one, start at two, three, wherever you left it off. Do you remember anything about the birth at Krishna's time? It's there in the book. It's a little bit-- I'm a little bit embarrassed saying that is a female body and so on so. -Okay. -Yeah. -You can be born as a female or a male? -Soul has no sex. Why does the soul choose to be born as a male or a female, depending on what experiences it needs to gather. There are different experiences for both? Yeah, generally. Yeah, of course. If male and a female face the same situation in life, you'll see there are two different reactions, hormonally different, various things. Would you like to shed some light on people who are born in trans bodies? Yes, of course. This is a case of some mix up of hormones where people are neither here nor there. Every human being has male and female hormones. It is well known. For some, the female hormones are more so they are females. For some, the men have more male hormones, so they are men. It's like that. But sometimes it-- Look, it's not a new thing. Shiva himself, one of his major manifestations is Ardhanarishvara, which means half male, half female. So which means certain characteristics like art, literature, things like that, they are more manifest in the feminine aspect of a human being. While strings of physical strength and go getting and things like that, they come from the male aspect. Even if your hormones are balanced and you are born into a male or as a female, it's a good idea to develop the opposite traits to some extent. For balance? For balance. So now, for instance, in yoga, Kriya and any other yoga, Pranayama, we know that there is the Ida and the Pingala. You'll have to give context, sir. Ida is the nadi that flows from the brain down to your, on the left side, and Pingala flows from the right to the left. It's like an astral nerve. Correct? But it corresponds to the-- The nadis correspond to the parasympathetic nervous system and the vagus nerve, which controls the heart, lungs, and so on. They are, but actually, we are talking about a psychic energy rather than a physical energy. Got it, so In the physical body, -It would be your vagus nerve. -Exactly, vagus nerve. -It actually has astral significance. -Yes. -Yes. -Okay. So when you say nadi, we mean both actually. -Sympathetic and parasympathetic? -Yeah and the Prana works through both. The Ida nadi on the right side is called the cool nadi. In fact, it's the feminine system. And the right is called the Pingala nadi, which is the plus. When I say plus and minus. Not in a bad way, minus, but opposite, like cathode and anode, let's say. So you can't say this is less and that is more. Without both, you cannot do anything. -Yes. -So in the practice of Pranayama, we try to balance both. So that is why they do what is called Anulom Vilom. Breathe in through one nostril, breathe in through the other. The Anulom Vilom, go in through the left, hold for a while, breathe out through the right, breathe into the right, hold and go out to the left. This is called an alternate breathing. This balances the plus and minus in your body. And for a spiritual person, it's required to balance both. You need both. Which is why some great people, not all, like Ramkrishna Paramhansa, the guru of Swami Vivekananda, everybody knows Swami. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, they did their sadhana, considering themselves as the consort of Krishna. But they had male bodies. They were not trans. They had male bodies. So, the mind was working that way. See, so for the yogi who doesn't want to get too much caught up in the emotional turmoil of these emotions, they balance the Ida and the Pingala through Anulom Vilom. Through the practice of Anulom Vilom, which is, I think, essential to move forward. -Okay. -It balances the nadis. Having said that, I think, both properties or both traits are part of a human being, male or female, although it may not in many instances be overtly visible as a physical manifestation. Okay. Have you ever been in love with a human being in this life? In this life? Yes, I have. This was after your spiritual journey began? First, I was in love with Maheshwarnath Babaji, my master. I mean, love doesn't mean only just physical. No, like romantic love. Romantic love, I had a little bit with my wife before I got married. But this was after your spiritual journey. Does spiritual growth -reduce the amount of romance? -No. -You can still be Shah Rukh Khan. -Of course. -Okay. -I know, I can't be Shah Rukh Khan. And I don't know how romantic he is. I really don't know. But what you see in film may not be the truth also, -Yeah. -Which we can't say. But I think it's possible somewhere there is a misunderstanding that if you are spiritual, your heart becomes stone. No. In fact, your heart becomes more sensitive and perhaps more selfless, but more sensitive. So emotions like love, affection, all these things are quite common. Attachment may not be there. Attachment is when you get obsessed with something. So when you're saying attachment is not there. Which means that you are not completely dependent on that. See, attachment is a question of dependence. Love need not be dependent. -Okay. -Can be free. Okay. Even romantic love? -Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. -Like even if they go, I will let them, -because I love them. -Yeah exactly. Maybe they like somebody better. -Why, why, sir? -Who knows? It's okay. No, no I'm kidding. Okay. Little straightforward question for you. What do you think your wife's past lives were, to land up with you, who's pretty much a sage in a modern body in this life? What good karma or generally what karma, she has done to have you as a husband? Can I put it this way? Because she might watch the podcast, maybe what good karma I did to be with her? -Yeah. -Let's put it this way. Actually, I don't know. I have not delved into her past lives. It's not allowed to look into somebody else's past life. It's like reading private letters. There must be something that she has ended up with... sometimes one would say crackpot like me and has gone through a lot of difficulties because of that. Because I'm never there. I'm going here, I'm going there. Very fact that she says, okay, that's how his life is and he is balanced shows a sign of spiritual maturity. Something is there otherwise not possible. I know there are lots of people who say, oh, we love you, sir, but it's different. Okay. Is she also spiritual? Spiritual, but she does her yoga. She's a good human being. She's a vegetarian. She's not interested in buying things, hoarding, none of these things. And she's a very kind person. If that is spiritual. Yes, she is. So other than meditation, sadhana, prayer, there are different activities that dictate how spiritual -or not spiritual you are. -Exactly like service. I meet people apart from my wife, I meet people who say that we don't believe in all this spiritual, God stuff, and all, but we believe that human beings are by nature truly good. Something is covering their feelings. So they are acting like this. And we like to serve human beings. They say, we like to serve human beings. We don't believe in any of this spiritual stuff that you're talking about. But we do service to unfortunate human beings. I think that is also a sign of spiritual maturity. Something in their past lives has brought them to that stage where they're able to do selfless work and help humanity. Such people, I personally believe after a while they will get automatically, naturally interested in spiritual things because the mind is getting purified. There are people with Sattva Guna. I want to talk about your first few days with your master because I am assuming you weren't meditating too much before that phase where you actually started meditating with him. True. What were the first few days of training like? I don't know whether you can call it training, but I'm assuming there were some things, he made you do, some activities that maybe purified you. This is where we begin creating the sequel from the last episode. A few key terms in that one -were higher beings, Yeti, Sri M, Babaji. -Yeah. So let's begin in that tangent again. See, it's like this. I was meditating. I won't say that I was not meditating, but I didn't know exactly how to go about it. I was doing in my own way, like many young people are interested I used to sit for some time in sunset and close my eyes. After Babaji met me and put his hand on my head at the age of 8. I was not normal after that. I mean, I did everything that young people did in school and college. But there was one part of my mind which was meditative, which was looking at how to acquire more knowledge regarding these matters, meeting people, all that was already happening. It's not that it was not happening. When I met Babaji for the first time physically again, I mean, this was only for five minutes. And I was 8 years old. And when I started living with him, he then put me into a certain route of meditation, like how many times, how many hours you should meditate. And then he taught me Kriya. Taught me how to practice Kriya. When it comes to Kriya yoga, a lot of our listeners have read "The Autobiography of a Yogi," where Kriya yoga is spoken about as a very fast way of advancing spiritually. But I believe there's also some sort of warm up that your body needs to reach that point. -Yes.-Correct? I told you, I think, I remember saying last time to you. That in the spiritual journey, there is no jet plane path. Everything is hard work. We need to, I mean, people have said that. -But I don't totally subscribe to this. -Okay. Just because you have taken Kriya, you shouldn't think that I am, now I am, no. There are many preparations required. You need to adjust your emotions, your feelings. Yama Niyamas have to be followed. And then when you have done that, it also depends on how much Kriya you're doing. If you ask ordinary, normal person to sit down, now do every day 3 hours of this, it's not possible. So you need to go slowly. So I started with half an hour. Babaji was an expert in this mind matters. First he told me half an hour, then you go 1 hour, then 45 minutes, 1 hour, like that. There was a time when I was meditating -almost 6 hours a day.-Really? 6 hours, meaning, doing Kriya for about 3-4 hours. 3 hours and then silent meditate. It's very important for all Kriya practitioners that after the technique, you have to meditate silently for some time. And that silent meditation period started increasing for me. Because when you do Kriya, you're absorbed in the inner, you begin to enjoy it. The last part of meditation is to just allow yourself to enjoy it without doing anything. No mantras or anything? Nothing. It's called pure Sakshi. Which means witness. Again, let me give some context to the listeners because a lot of people associate meditation with maybe some Western techniques that they've learned. And those are also fine. But it's about focus on your breath, focus on the sounds around you. When you're talking about Kriya or Kriya related meditations, there's a very particular technique. It might be something related -to breathing or a mantra.-It is. -Which pushes you into a very deep state. -Exactly. It is a focus-based technique. But then when you come out of it and there are ways to come out you need to spend some time in silence and just absorb-- See, I'm losing words. Just absorb what your body has seen. Very important. This is very important. At the end, this has to be done. So I did that. And then Babaji always traveled. He never stayed in one place for very long. So he traveled from place to place. He always went on foot. So I also walked with him. There's no way out. And everywhere we stopped whenever he found a good, great yogi or somebody who has-- Sometimes, he used to take me to people, today I don't consider to be great yogis. That time I would have fallen for it. They had some powers like they used some sidhis and they used to do something. Normally I would have fallen for it. Babaji always alerted me. This is not the end of the journey. I won't tell you in this part. It's interesting. Many people come and say, can I have this sidhi, that sidhi? In Ashtanga yoga, there are ashta sidhis. And Yoga Sutra also can, I just tell them, look, this is not the aim of your practice. Yes. As you practice on the way you might come across such things. But they are useless move forward. They are distractions from the end goal. I must tell you this. It's not people say, oh, it's because you cannot do anything you're saying. Sorry, I said, it's not like that. So this Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had a guru, he had many gurus. One of his gurus was Bhairavi Brahmani, who's a lady, who was supposed to have been a disciple of Trailanga Swami the Great, whose samadhi is in Banaras. She taught him the Vaishnava Tantras and she went off. Many years later, two of Ramakrishna's guru bhais, one of them's name-- One name was Manikandan. He came back and met Ramakrishna. And he used to call him Gadadhar because they know each other. And he said-- Ramakrishna had a habit of late night, midnight to walk away into the Panchavati, a group of five trees near Dakshineswar and meditate at midnight. He had to take a lantern and go. So one day Manikandan said, hey, guru bhai, dada, you don't need a lantern. He said why? He said, Because I have a light here. Okay, I can put that light for you. And the story is that he opened his, whatever and showed a light. And Ramakrishna went and meditated and came back. After coming back, Ramakrishna said to him you may think I don't have these capacities. Doesn't matter, I'm not interested. But this is not good for you. From tomorrow, you cannot use this light. It is gone and it was gone. Why was it not good for him? What is the use of showing light in the night? So he will a torch. It's as simple as that. You have to do more things. So I saw a lot of great kind of yogi types and all. I was not... Babji also explained to me the principle how these things operate. They're not such a big deal if you practice certain things, 6 days, 7 days with me, you can also do such things. It's not a big deal. When do I get to meet you, sir? No, no. I am kidding. For instance, I went to Lakshman Jhula. There, behind the mountain, there was a yogi, Nepalis yogi. This is Rishikesh. Beyond Rishikesh. Devprayag. So where the Bhagirathi -and the Mandakini meet. -Okay. So, I went there. This yogi said, he said, look I can do this, this, this, this. So, Babaji was smiling. He said, "sun le kuch mat bolna." He said, listen, don't say anything. Then he said, look here, my hands are here. He showed like this. My hands are here. Look, look here. So he said, here, like this. Then he did like this. Then he produced one Rudraksha. And he said, this I-- Then he said, where did this come from? I can give it to you. It won't disappear. You can keep it forever. Put it in your neck. Do you want to put it in your neck? No. Afterwards. Like this, what you have. Oh, my God. If you want, then I will make a hole for you. I just got to give the listeners some context. Can I give a hole in this so that you can use it? Yes, sir. Put a string. -Yeah. -My God. Okay. -This is on camera? -I don't know. It got captured on camera-- For the audio listeners, on camera, we just, A Rudraksha got created out of thin air. It smells very nice. You want to check? This is an honor. Smell. -My God. -Nice. So what I mean to say is I have seen all this. But I don't think it's a big deal. This is not a big deal. You come with me. Stay nine days. You will also do, why did I do this? Just to tell you that it's not a big deal. This is not what we are aiming at. I'm a little speechless. So sorry, okay. Producing ashes. Producing… See what happens? People get sidetracked and go away and then they always expect this thing to happen. I'm saying, so I watched all this. That was part of my spirit… Since you asked me about spiritual training, I was taken to all these guys and shown all these things and said look, this is not it. Meditate deeper. Go to your inner essence. So this was part of the training. -To go beyond the distraction. -Yes. And this is nothing. See, this Rudraksha is not produced from thin air. Let me put it. It's somewhere. But I have agencies which can bring them here. That is different. Not physical agencies. Higher beings? Whatever, higher, lower, little fellows. What I'm trying to say, it's not a big deal. You don't have to be highly spiritual person to do this also. I've seen horrible people, but they have some powers like this. Karna Pishachini or something. They say it's talking to me. It's telling me about your life and things, and people fall for it. Wow. Okay. So many thoughts right now. The question I have for you, sir, is what's happening in the world right now? And why are you why are you, why are you appearing on podcasts? Can you keep that safe? It's with me. Okay. It's very dear to me. What is happening in the world and why am I on the podcast? Okay, I'll tell you where this question comes from. I would not have dared to do podcasts -like this even 3 years ago 4 years ago. -Correct. -I just felt like audiences weren't ready. -Right. The questions that are coming up and the questions that are being accepted by audiences now are different. Post the pandemic. Plus, we're seeing war in the world, we're seeing earthquakes in the world. -This is not a normal decade. -True. What is happening? And where are we going? Where is the human race going? The saddest news is that there are cracks appearing in Joshimath. -Yes. -Right? Now, these cracks, if they extend to Badri, what will happen? So what has happened is human beings have misused nature. Environmentally, it's in a very bad shape. You can make highways to go to Badrinath. But that's not everything. The ecosystem in the Himalayas is so sensitive and so kind of, it sits on a fault line. So we have to be very careful with this. It's not just having highways. Okay, I understand. It's easier for people to go. They say, oh, there are highways in Switzerland, but Switzerland's Alps don't sit on a fault. So I have a feeling that now people seeing this happening floods, sea levels are rising, icebergs are melting. Cruelty in human beings in general is increasing. All kinds of things are happening. Of course, there is one side where spiritual, yeah. So I think the young person also has begun to think, because the future belongs to the young, began to think that this is not everything. There must be something more to it. -Like spiritual. -Definitely. Because we in India are lucky because we have been exposed to it for so many years, which may not be the case with other people. So people have begun to think, is there something more than this? Is this all there is to? Are we going to die suddenly after an earthquake or something happening? How many people died in Turkey recently? So all these disasters are a pointer towards saying, well, this is not everything. There is something more than this which can never be created or destroyed. So when young people begin to look into this and they're searching for it, podcasts like yours are important. And so I agreed to come for this, because I want to provide some kind of a link to these people. They're wandering around here and there. Had your master told you that a difficult time will come? Yes, he did. And many of the things he said are happening now. In that time, I used to think that maybe some things will happen, some may not happen, but many things which he said are happening. Sea level rising. When he said that, I couldn't believe it, at that time. He said the ice in Antarctica will melt. He said, there will be earthquakes in the Himalayas. I said, It is a sacred place. He said, yeah, but it is still a physical system. It can happen. Today, this thing. He also said, which is a positive thing, that young will get interested in spiritual matter. This is a very important, positive take on this. He said the young people will also get interested in spiritual matters, and this is important to prevent disasters in future. He said they are the people who are going to take over next this world. And it's good that they go with this understanding and background, which is why I also try to concentrate on the young. I go to Satsangs, when I see more young people, I'm really happy because I think I'm doing my job. He also said, since we are on the subject, that one day, thousands of people will be listening to you. So get ready for it. Have substance to talk to them. Is this signed off -as a difficult decade for humans? -Yes. -The 20s? -Very difficult decade for human. But once we cross this, we will come out better. It's a reformatory. Purification? Does India have a very, very big role this decade? India has a very important role in this decade. Not as people say, just on the economic front and so on, but also from the point of view of spiritual awakening and understanding. Now, when you say spiritual, don't equate it only with religious. When I say spiritual, looking into the source of things, looking into the source of the outer world, as well as the source of the inner world, these are very scientific things. And in our tradition in India, the spiritual content is so good that one could look into these and find answers. Vedic mathematics, for instance. Today the computer runs on one and zero. Who invented the concept of zero, shunya? I know somebody who is-- I don't totally agree many things with him. He is a very orthodox person, good man, head of a mut and so on. Many people don't know that this man, they think that he's ignoramus. So he's talking like this. 28 books on Vedic mathematics he has authored because he won't come on a podcast, I'm sure. I don't know unless you can, but such things are part of our eternal tradition, and it is important that we talk about it now. The world is beginning to realize also. See how many foreigners are coming and searching for various things here. I don't know whether I should ask you this question or not. And I ask you this question because I've actually asked a lot of military men this off camera. Is the world gearing up for a world war-type situation, according to you? Luckily, world war will not be allowed to happen. Even if it begins somehow, they will put an end to it. Because if a world war happens, there is always going to be nuclear war. Nobody can afford nuclear war, so I don't think this will happen. Okay, okay. But the situation may look like it's going towards that, which is a good sign. We should start changing from here. I'm a little thrown off -because of this response honestly. -Sorry. I shouldn't have given it till the last… No, no, sir. The subject came up, so I was-- No, I really appreciate. One thing I'll be very raw and honest with you about. I meet a lot of 13 and 14 year olds who've begun watching the show now. -Which I find strange. -Why? Nice. I've been doing this job for eight years, and I've always given these videos, not the podcast. I used to create videos before the podcast. I used to give it my 200% effort, but only eight years down the line, now, I'm reaching out to much larger audiences. Right, right. And the reason they get into the show is because of the videos related to ghosts and horror. And I won't lie, I'm doing those episodes in order to reach out to a wider audience. Though in my heart, I'm doing it for episodes like this. -We talk about higher concepts. -Right, right. Yesterday I met a group of 14 year olds, very well dressed and cool guys, and I went to them and I was like, what videos do you watch? And I assumed they'd say, fashion videos. They were like, no, we watch your spiritual stuff. I was like, you're 13 years old, you're 14 years old. What makes you watch the spiritual stuff? But then that was a good sign for me as well. Now, the question I'll ask you, sir, is the horror related stuff. -Horror? -Yeah. For actually gripping more 13, 14-year-olds. Are these guys advanced souls, like the group of kids, because they know way more than what we knew at 13-14. Yeah, the young ones who are coming now, some have come. Some are coming. Even the generation younger than me, some of them at least, are mature souls who have come for a purpose. Even the IQ is much better than when we were that age. -Yeah. -Not you, I. Which is a good sign. Which means we are evolving. We are getting human beings, now. At one time, evolving meant scientific, material, economic. Now we are moving out from the frontal lobe civilization into something different. That parts of the brain which look into these matters are activated in many young people. So they will ask questions there. I have one at home now who looks very curious, but I think he's going to ask me these questions after a while. I have a grandson now who is two years old and his common word he uses, anything is no, Neti. Not this, not this. Like Shankara said Neti. And recently only he had started learning to say yeah, but till now he has been saying no. So when I look at him, I see that the mind is very inquisitive. It's not because, he is my grandson. It's that I've seen many such young people. Yesterday I met a young girl who told her mother, hey, you should start meditating. And you know how old she is? Yesterday she was there at the marriage, had gone for a wedding. Four years. Four and a half years. Where does it come from in the head? -It's stored somewhere. -Yes. I'm saying this, in the beginning when I used to go for this. We have Shibhir, which means a retreat in different places. It's a 2-1/2-day retreat. And at the end I give Kriya. So, we have a stipulation that below the age of 12, we don't give Kriya. Some years, from 4 years, 3 years ago, people started bringing kids 12 years old. Hey, they're too small. They just passed 12. You said 12 is okay. And this is increasing now. Because the kids are telling their mom and father, We also want to take Kriya, why only you? This has never happened before. -I'm relating it to what you said. -Yes. A group of youngsters who said, we are listening to spiritual videos. What the hell you think? Because at that age, normally one wouldn't have been looking at that. -Yeah. -So the new generation, while on one hand is one set which is a little bit too destructive in a sense. There's also another set coming up -which is very creative in this matter? -Geniuses. I think they will balance. We had a very advanced Tantra practitioner on the show and I feel his presence on the show, his name is Rajarshi Nandi. He came for two reasons. One, kind of a similar reason to why you came. To talk about these things on a public platform, finally. The weird thing is he came on Kaal Bhairav Jayanti, came on that day and he recorded like five incredible episodes with us. People have really lost their minds about those episodes. Because the kind of stuff he said, the internet in general doesn't have that kind of content. Two, he shifted my path. He answered so many of the questions other people have not been able to answer. There have only been two people who've been able to answer these things precisely, and that's you and him. His name is Rajarshi Nandi. I want to ask you about Tantra and where it fits into the spiritual path. My reading of it, is that it's not for everyone, firstly. It does have a fierce aspect. But if you're guided in it gradually, it makes your path even faster. But that's not exactly why you should go into it. Would you like to highlight Tantra a little bit? Because when I told my mother that I've started doing some mantras, she's like, what is all this? First time, it was about ghosts. Now you're getting into Tantra. But I don't look at it as a negative thing. Somewhere along the line, this Tantra has acquired a very bad name normally because people associate Tantra only with the Aghoris, or people who live in the smashans, or people who drink and have all kinds of orgies. This is the picture presented in Tantra. But really, Tantra is not just-- Look, first we must understand the word Yantra, Mantra, Tantra. Yantra is a diagram. -Tantra is a diagram? -Yantra. -Yantra is a diagram. -Is a diagram. Mantra is the sound that activates that machine. Yantra also means a machine. You know that. Could a crystal like that be a Yantra? Could be. An object? Object, but it should have some signal by which it can attract forces. A symbol. That is called the Yantra. -Okay. -The diagram, the yantra. And Mantra is what activates the energy inside. And Tantra is a combination of both. Okay, now the meaning of-- Now you should also understand that when you say Tantra, traditionally there are two parts. One is called the Kaulachara or the left hand path, Vamachara. And the other is the Samaya Marga. Two paths. Adi Shankara who wrote the Soundarya Lahari was a Samaya Margi. He practiced the right-hand path. Liquor is not used. None of the Panchamakaras are used. -You know what are Panchamakaras? -Yes, yes. They're not used. Because they're all produced within the body through meditation and so on. Tough path. Vamachara believes that human beings, most of us, are categorized as Pashu level, which means still animals. We cannot direct, give up everything and suddenly go to high spiritual levels. Which is only few talented people or people with that background can do. What about the rest? Though they said enjoy and move forward. This is Tantra. So the key word used in Tantra, the slogan is Yogo Bhogo Yogayate. That means Yoga is Bhoga. Bhoga is enjoyment. So when you do yoga, what happens? You enjoy internally. When your Kundalini is awakened. Where does it awaken from? From the Muladhara. Where is the Muladhara? Just behind your reproductive organs. It is the same energy which flows downwards. That one has sexual enjoyment. One who really knows Tantra has learned how to activate this energy and make it also ascend upwards. Sometimes it can happen also through an act, which is why this bad name has come to Tantra. But that has to be done very carefully with proper guidance. Otherwise, you will just end up like any other physical act. One has to learn how to do Khechari. One should know how to Vajroli and how to not allow the energy to go, but to hold it. And so, I mean, it's an elaborate subject, what I'm trying to say, there are two parts in Tantra. Left-handed path. Left-handed path makes use of the five makaras because they believe human beings cannot give up everything and go there only through enjoyment and then slowly, slowly moving forward. Panchamakaras meaning five Ms. Makara is M alphabet. It is matsya, maṃsa, madu which is madya, maithuna, and forgot the one more. -It's basically gains. -Grains, grains, yeah. -Grain, fish, meat, alcohol, sex. -Yes. So what they're trying to do is, using this to sublimate the mind. Not to remain there, but to sublimate the mind. So, this is the part, the Kaulachara, it's also called. All the Kauls in in Kashmir come from that, you see. But that does not mean that it is merely a kind of a, what is it called? Partying kind of thing, Tantra. It's a very serious affair. And if proper teacher is there, one can definitely practice. Now, since we are on the subject, I want you to be clear about a picture of Tantra which will take many such episodes, maybe. So I would suggest that fortunately, there is a beautiful text which has been translated into English. It's written by somebody called Arthur Avalon who also wrote, The Serpent Power. Serpent Power is about the Kundalini. He wrote The Serpent Power, which is actually a translation of Purnananda Yogi's Shat-Chakra-Nirupana. Description of the six chakras. So Arthur Avalon was-- His name actually is Sir John Woodroffe. Is good for everybody to understand Tantra. For the viewers especially. He was a judge of the Calcutta High Court. He was an Englishman. So, John Woodroffe was so interested in Tantra that later on he resigned from the High Court and spent time with the Tantrics. And Bengal is a very good center of Tantra. So, studying, on based of studying-- based on studying the textbooks of Tantra more than the practical aspects, he wrote an excellent book called Introduction to Tantra. I think you should read it. -Introduction? -Yeah, Introduction to Tantra. -All right. -And a few other books which are technical. No need to go into that. And Shat-Chakra-Nirupana, which is The Serpent Power. These two books. This will give a complete picture of what Tantra is and what are the textbooks you can rely on for understanding Tantra. So that one gets free of this idea that Tantra is just ghosts and ghouls, and you know all those. Because I know a lot of the listeners are listening to this episode for that reason. One thing I learned from the episode with Rajarshi, sir was that when your path moves forward there will be forces which will try to pull you back Of course. And of course, these forces can be in other people's minds and hearts where they doubt you and they say, -no, no you won't be able to do it. -Absolutely. But it can also actually be darker forces. Sometimes it could be darker forces influencing those people to pull you back. Possible. I want to know about this whole dark aspect which is kind of the antithesis to spiritual growth. Can I say something? Sure, sir. The moment you begin to think or apply your mind to this, their presence becomes stronger. It's better to use other things and positive things so that they don't have time to enter. Okay. Would you not like to talk about it for the same reason? -Yeah. -Okay. Understood. This Babaji taught me. When you discuss these matters, they're all there. Come out of that. Discuss about the higher good beings and they're not there. Okay, fine. I will ask you the one burning question -then that I've saved up till the end. -Sure. -Am I doing something wrong. -No, no. In my life by talking about the dark things on the internet? No, no, no. I'm saying the principle, the basic principle is that when you are talking about them, their presence is there. But here you need not worry. I'm there, which one is... You've had to deal with these things? Yes. I did sometimes. I have written it also in my biography in some places, I've mentioned it. I had to put up a tough fight sometimes. -Even now? -No, no. -Now now, they don't come near? -From far. Because there are already higher beings with you. -Yeah. -Okay. And it's actually a fight between those-- Not only because of having higher beings, but now they look at me as a higher being. One last question for you, sir. On today's episode, what advice do you have for me? I think you should continue to do what you're doing. Good work. Apart from that, also develop a routine of personal sadhana for yourself. -Okay. -Some kind of personal sadhana. I think you might be doing. But in case you are not, then better to start some quiet meditation, some sadhana, Hamsa, what we call in Kriya yoga. You should do that every day so that tomorrow you will probably understand things better even when you talk to others who are in this field and for your own personal spiritual growth. Other than that, this is a wonderful thing that you're doing. -These conversations? -Yes. Because lots of people get to know things which they wouldn't have got to know on Internet. Is this also a sort of service? -I think it's a service. -Okay. Certainly, it's a service from my point of view. Look, I can talk. I can have Satsangs. But that won't have as much reach as this. Since we are talking together now, how many people will know, right? That way you're doing a service to Babaji, not just to me. You are getting me to do my work better, actually. Sometimes you need questions to shape up. -Of course. -Thoughts. You should always have questions open. This idea that you should not ask questions, you should not doubt, I think they came much later. In the beginning, even the first hymn of creation ends by saying perhaps he on high knows, or maybe he knows not. Without doubt and without questioning, you cannot explore anything. One last question, sir, for you. There is a strong desire on my heart to almost now start, giving up on a material life. This has just come out of nowhere, probably over the last year. Maybe I saw like a peak of materialism. And what I mean by materialism is the presence of everything. Everything that I hoped for when my career began. I wanted money, I wanted fame, I wanted public validation. Experienced all three. There is genuinely a part of me that now wants to leave and just focus on sadhana. And that will mean stopping the show, perhaps. That will mean stopping youtubing, leaving fame. Can you? Can you-- Like the Bhagavad Gita, stay in the battlefield and continue with your spirit… -Okay. -Kurukshetra. This is all a Kurukshetra. So consider it that you're doing something good and that you're not doing it only for name, fame and so on. The name, fame all was necessary to make it popular and so on. Now you don't have to do any such thing. You just do what comes to your mind naturally. You'll be doing good. So why would you quit and then go in? It's a question of mindset. -Understood and circumstance. -Also. Sri M, sir. Thank you. Just I mean, thank you to you. -Thank you to the high beings. -Whoever. Gave you the answers in this one. Thank you to the high beings that gave me the questions. That's all, I'll say. I'm just very grateful that I get to interact with people like yourself. And I am-- -Maybe we meet again. -Yes. I'm hoping to see you very soon, sir. I hope I did justice to this conversation. I think so. You should come sometime to Madanapalle. I intend to. I intend to. You should do that. Very quiet place. Yeah. There's a lot of like-- Spend one or two days quietly. Don't have to interview nothing. -Or maybe I do. -That is up to you. But even otherwise, you can just come, spend some quiet time, -see what we are doing. -Yeah. There's a lot of turmoil right now. One thing I've noticed is life is a continuous process of seeing turmoil and then seeing phases of just peace. So very important conversation for me. I want to say thank you and so many other things -that are packed into that one thank you. -Thank you. Thank you, sir. So that was the episode for today. The space that you see me recording, and especially if you're seeing the video version of this podcast, this is our interim space because our current space is being renovated. I do believe that when you have this kind of a conversation with a spiritual master like Sri M. If you're talking to them for so long, if you're extracting their knowledge, if you even simply invite them into a space, the entire space gets blessed. The entire space's energy changes. I'd go as far as saying that when it comes to some people who are this spiritually advanced, like Sri M, even when you listen to their podcasts, when you hear their voice, there is a certain amount of energy and calm that would spread in your room. If you're listening to this on speaker, in your mind, if you're listening to this on earphones or headphones, that's the true joy of creating these episodes for you. Lots more to learn from the Himalayan Master. Definitely going to be doing a Hindi episode very soon. I do recommend that you guys check out our Hindi podcast.

有時你發現一個人也許是30-40歲的人，參與了你不喜歡的事情。可怕的事情。然後有一天他醒了，他意識到，啊，這不是我的目的。然後他就回去了。爲什麼？因爲正如克里希納在《吉塔》中對阿朱納說的那樣，無論你做了什麼精神上的悲願，它都在那裏，就像你的銀行餘額一樣，無論你來多少次。他說，看，我可以做這個，這個，這個。所以，巴巴吉在笑。他說，"sun le kuch mat bolna"。他說，聽着，不要說什麼。然後他說，看這裏，我的手在這裏。他像這樣展示。我的手在這裏。看，看這裏。所以他說，這裏，像這樣。然後他就像這樣做了。然後他拿出一個金剛菩提子。他說，這個我......然後他說，這是從哪裏來的？我可以把它給你。它不會消失。你可以永遠保留它。把它放在你的脖子上。你想把它放在你的脖子裏嗎？不，事後。像這樣，你所擁有的。哦，我的上帝。如果你願意，那我就給你開個洞。我只是要給聽衆一些背景。我可以在這上面給一個洞，這樣你就可以使用它了嗎？是的，先生。放一根繩子。-是的 -我的上帝 好的。 -這是在攝像機上？-我不知道。它被拍到了... ...對於音頻聽衆來說，在攝像機上，我們只是... ...一個金剛菩提子被憑空創造出來。它聞起來非常好。你想看看嗎？縱觀 "蘭維爾秀 "的旅程，我們有一些非常史詩性的時刻，但沒有一個像喜馬拉雅大師Sri M在節目現場憑空創造出金剛菩提子那樣史詩性。這個時刻一直伴隨着我的團隊。從我們錄製這個播客的那天起，我們就一直在討論它。但說實話，每次我們和Sri M談話時，他都會給我們一些最史詩般的內容。我相信他與我們的最後一集是TRS有史以來瀏覽量最高的一集。我強烈建議你去看看，瞭解這個人的故事。因爲這一集更以哲學爲中心，更以思想爲中心，我甚至可以說更深刻，更有精神上的滿足感。如果你是一個喜歡TRS的精神類節目的人，那麼與Sri M的這一集會讓你非常難忘。如果想了解更多類似的劇集，請務必在Spotify上關注我們。每一集都會在世界其他地方發佈前48小時在Spotify上發佈。因爲我們是Spotify的獨家。在我讓你溜進這一集之前，我要提醒你，我的冥想應用程序Level SuperMind現在已經在App Store和Play Store上線。請確保你下載它。確保你使用它。特別是如果你希望開始或加強你的冥想過程。與你真正的Sri M的史詩般的情節現在開始了。🎶[音樂]🎶 🎶[音樂]🎶 🎶 Sri M，先生。歡迎回到The Ranveer Show。謝謝你。納馬什卡。你好嗎，先生？我很好，非常好。上一次的節目是超越史詩的。它是如此的史詩。它有這麼多學問，這麼多故事。觀衆們有點稱它是他們最喜歡的一集。-這很好聽。因爲你們所有的經歷，我們獲得了大量的瀏覽量。這也是因爲問題，適當的問題。我很高興，先生。很榮幸能再次和你一起做這個，說實話。謝謝你。自從我們上次談話後，你的生活有什麼變化嗎？是的，就是我變得越來越忙了。-我是說，這就是變化。-好吧。也許這些天我厭倦了刮鬍子。除此之外，沒有什麼變化。我太忙了。我覺得鬍鬚看起來很酷。謝謝你。你身上有點板球運動員的氣息。好的，那麼上一次，我們做播客的方式是我們做了你的故事，從你的童年--直到可能19或20歲。-是的。就在這20年裏，我們提取了許多故事和許多信息。-是的。我想從兩個方面來介紹這個播客。-一是延續上次的內容。-好的。 但是，第二，說實話，是我自己的很多問題，因爲在很長時間之後， -我們正在進行一次精神對話。-當然，當然。所以我想，我們就從這裏開始吧，先生。好的。在你的生活中，有一段很長的時間，你和你的大師一起進行了非常認真的唸佛。-是的。我想這就是我們上次離開的地方。-是的。所以我想讓你從那裏開始。也許讓我們實際上從一個非常簡單的問題開始，也就是大師的概念。我認爲很多年輕的靈性尋求者甚至不瞭解這一點有多重要。而這是我通過節目獲得的一個教訓，你可能通過互聯網、通過谷歌獲得靈性知識，但這可能是危險的。所以，有兩個問題。什麼是大師？第二個問題是，如果你在沒有大師的情況下這樣做，爲什麼會有危險？對。因此，首先回答你的第二個問題，從這個詞的意義上來說，它實際上並不危險，但你可能會在沒有走上正確軌道的情況下四處遊蕩。從靈性的角度來看，這本身就是浪費時間，如果你沒有一個合適的老師，你可能會以自己的方式四處遊蕩，很好地學習。但是，如果沒有適當的指導，等到你回頭看的時候，你可能已經花了很多時間，無法做任何實質性的事情。這個問題是存在的。你說的四處遊蕩，是指不同的路徑嗎？不是不同的路徑。不僅是不同的路徑。看，如果你進入互聯網，你看到各種老師，各種教義，然後你不知道如何選擇？該怎麼做？所以你在這裏做一點，在那裏做一點。你做了一點......沒有全神貫注地去唸佛，你看，無論你選擇什麼道路。因此，一個人浪費了很多時間。就我而言，我很幸運，儘管我遇到了許多宗教......瑜伽師和靈性人士，但我找到了馬赫什瓦納特-巴巴吉，我有點接受他作爲我的老師。所以這對我來說要好一點，因爲我得到了正確的指導。如果我有疑問，我可以問他。有時，如果我做錯了什麼，我將在某種程度上受到懲罰。而當我做了一件好事時，會有一些讚賞。這裏是一個經驗和知識的寶庫，我從他那裏得到了很多的好處。好的，所以這就是爲什麼它可能會更好。當然，有很多部分。問題是，我們所尋找的一般是精神上的，我說的是純粹的精神上的，而不是良好的健康、良好的心態。所有這些都是你練習瑜伽和冥想的一部分。但是假設一個人在尋找更高的地平線，你在尋找純粹的精神，那麼它是如此的廣闊和無限，不能說這是通往它的唯一途徑。我不說。我總是說克里雅瑜伽是我的parampara，我的傳統。但是Babaji自己經常問，Mirabai做了什麼Kriya？你必須給聽衆一些關於米拉白是誰的背景。現在，印度的米拉拜，許多人知道米拉拜是一位公主，是拉賈斯坦邦或某個地方的女王，我不知道，古吉拉特邦，我不確定。現在，她是一個克里希納信徒。一直以來，她都在崇拜她的克里希納，並希望與克里希納有一個達善的實際會面。她沒有任何關於經文的知識。她沒有任何這樣的東西。然而，她應該是非常有靈性的，她有很多達善，她崇拜的是克里希納的無限神。她沒有練習任何呼吸法，沒有做任何瑜伽。她不知道任何這些事情。但她確實到了那裏，而且她是一個如此重要的人，以至於像拉瑪南達這樣的偉大瑜伽師，當他，你知道，他曾經不認識女人。他常常把自己關起來，他要一個一個地見人。如果女人去了，他會說，我不想見她們，因爲她們會分散瑜伽師的注意力。是的。所以米拉貝去那裏見他。他說，我不想去。有人說這就是米拉白。他說，不，我還是不想見她。於是米拉貝給他發了一張紙條。她說，你不想見女人？從我的角度來看，只有一個男人，克里希納。你們都是女人。所以他說，把她帶進來。所以這樣的人沒有做任何克里雅瑜伽或類似的事情。沒有Pranayama。沒有任何東西。我不是說這是我的帕拉帕拉，我將全力捍衛它。但是，是的。而拉瑪納-馬哈希在另一邊，他是在Jnani。我的意思是，一個通過調查尋求真理的人。-Jnana瑜伽。-好吧，通過詢問？質詢，試圖爲自己找到答案。他的真實身份是什麼？他是誰？他唯一的一個公式，他說Deham Naham Koham Soham，意思是我不是身體。那麼我是誰？我是那個Soham。Soham的意思是它不僅僅是一個咒語。Soham的意思是我是。Soham! 所以，Babaji總是問，不要以爲每個人都要做Kriya。有一些人是有瑜珈傾向的。對他們來說，Kriya是好的。但即使是克里雅也會成爲一種機械的練習。如果你沒有認真探究，試圖找出你的真實身份。而且你的心中沒有一點點虔誠，它就會變成一種機械的練習。就像卡比爾-達斯常說的，Jadhad Prem Na Sanchare，Sodhad Jan Smashan。Jaise Khaal Lohar Ki, Saans Let Bin Praan. 意思是說，如果心中沒有奉獻、愛等，那就像一個smashan，像一個火葬場一樣好。他說，即使是鐵匠的風箱，你知道鐵匠的那些老式風箱，它們也會呼吸，但它們沒有生命。所以，即使是克里雅也不應該成爲一個機械過程。它們應該是爲前進而掙扎。應該有一定量的梵行。我稱它爲 "心"，等等。所以這就是爲什麼，爲什麼我說這一切是因爲我有一個老師，他正確地教了我這一切。因此，我認爲在某種程度上，即使你花了一些時間試圖探索什麼是我的道路，最後，點擊進入某人並繼續練習是個好主意。如果你一直到處挖井，10英尺，然後再挖一個，你不會得到水。一個地方，要深入。你可能會在那裏得到一些東西。好吧，我之所以提出這個問題，是因爲在過去兩週裏，這是一個非常活躍的問題。我們在節目中請到了一些非常不可思議的名人，他們似乎都在一定程度上實現了自我實現。有維蘭德-塞瓦格、薩拉-阿里-汗、馬諾伊-巴傑派和其他一些人。而每個人都強調了命運在他們自己的旅程中是多麼重要。當然，我知道命運起着一定的作用。但奇怪的是，在我們做的這6-7次播客中，每個人都提到了命運，以及他們是如何成爲環境的結果，而環境也是我一直在思考的問題。我覺得即使是這個播客的發生，也是因爲我和我母親的關係是一種非常的播客關係。從我還是個小孩子開始。總是有深刻的對話，雙方的故事。這就是爲什麼我喜歡這份工作。這些是我的情況。你是否相信命運在精神旅程中也是一個非常重要的因素？
   就像，每個人都有自己的時間線，不管是誰，其實都是爲了落入這條道路，都會落入自己的道路。我確實相信有某種計劃，當然，你可以稱之爲命運。但同時，也有很多人得到了這個計劃--但他們卻無法向前邁進。-真的嗎？因爲他們沒有爲之付出足夠的努力。所以我也對努力給予同等重視。我們已經通過了也許2億年的遺傳進化，對嗎？所以有很多遺傳學的混合和重新混合。所以你看到的每一個人，都是200萬年的混合體，所以我們大腦的某些部分已經因爲基因的關係而形成了，對嗎？我們不能否認這一點。即使你不願意相信過去的出生，但你仍然在某種程度上是有線路的。2億年。甚至沒有兩次出生或三次出生。遺傳進化。現在，鑑於我們也被賦予了工作的機會和空缺，當這個機會來臨時，我們需要利用這個機會，那麼它當然是有效的。如果它不工作，關於理解的一件事是，好吧，它沒有工作可能是因爲，我沒有付出足夠的努力，或者也許我不是註定的。所以讓我改變一下，看看其他的方式。有兩種看問題的方式。我是說對於年輕人來說，特別是你剛纔提到的，很多人都是年輕人。因此，雖然，是的，他們讚賞他們在某種程度上是註定的，但他們付出了很多努力。Virender Sehwag如果沒有擊球或保齡球，就不可能達到那裏。我不知道他做了什麼，一起做了幾個小時。可能有，我必須告訴你這一點，幾年前我去了香港。有一個叫Harilela的人。他還在那裏，我想。他當時一定是92歲了，有點偏胖，但非常活躍等等。所以他邀請我在他自己的酒店裏喫午飯。所以他告訴我，這種生活就像蛇和梯子。我說，你爲什麼這麼說？他說，因爲......他還擁有所有的......--那是什麼？假日旅館。-哦，假日酒店。在整個南亞地區。-好吧，大人物。印地語人。所以他告訴我，是蛇。我說，你爲什麼這麼說？他說，有時你是向上的，有時你是向下的。而那個人，當他倒下的時候，認爲我應該上去，是那個最後站起來的人。但後來他說，運氣。他說這是運氣，因爲命運也在發揮它的作用。他說，他在香港開始了他的職業生涯，是一個可以在一夜之間製作西服的裁縫。意思是說，你在早上下訂單，晚上就能拿到貨。當時有很多西方人，他當時在香港開始的那個點，他說，我的很多朋友也在做同樣的生意。他們也在做同樣的事情。我上來了，他們沒有，我不能解釋這個。說它是運氣，說它是命運。但他說我非常努力工作。如果我不努力工作，我不可能上來。但也有其他人也在努力工作，但沒有上來。所以你必須在這兩件事之間取得平衡。-你不能簡單地說命運和睡眠。-好吧。當你的機會來了，藍圖也準備好了，-你應該開始工作。-好的。 爲了理解這個機會來臨的概念，我現在要問你的一件事是再次的故事，我想上次我們沒有觸及的東西是你在出生在這個身體之前的時間。我知道這是你在你的書中談到的東西。有很多讀過你的書的讀者都查看了播客。如果你看一下我們那一集的評論區，很多人都要求回答這個問題。是的。所以我在自傳之後寫了一本書。-它被稱爲 "旅程繼續"。-好的。 在其中我陳述了一些我過去的生活經歷。所以我沒能把很多人放在一起，但那些我可以以某種方式放在一起的人，這些我都寫了關於我過去的生活。在那裏你會看到，即使是這個，坐在這裏的我，也是在今生才完全達到了某種程度的精神理解。我在許多生命中都很努力。即使我有一個老師來了，--Babaji也跟着我過了很多世。-真的。確切地說，我是跟着他走了很多世。我的第一次經歷把我，我所記得的，甚至把我帶回到了克里希納的時代。而在那之後，作爲Jaisalmer統治家族的創始人之一，甚至在Jaisal之前。所有這些地方，都有一些指導者給我。有一個老師。從Jaisalmer，Babaji進入了畫面，事實上，是他爲Jaisalmer王室設計了紋章。然後經過大量的戰爭，他說，現在結束它。現在完全進入你的精神道路。這就是開始。所以，我可以說的是--你可以從這裏得出的結論是，一個人很早就開始，並努力工作。你可能會花很多時間來達到一個點，這是你達到精神理解的最後一個生命。所以說，有些人很早就得到了它，有些人，甚至直到他們死了，他們也不能找到它。那些年輕時就得到它的人是那些已經以一種偉大的方式經歷了許多次的人。而今生，他們正在完成他們的唸佛。什麼是年輕？有些人在8歲的時候，比如說，巴巴吉突然拜訪了我，人們會認爲。但不是，這是與過去的聯繫。那是誰呢？拉瑪納-馬哈希在14歲的時候，他突然得到這個經驗，他與他的身體分離了。在那之前他沒有做任何唸誦。他沒有老師，什麼都沒有，沒有我們所知道的。他感覺到他離開了他的身體。然後他看到他的身體躺在那裏，他對自己說，如果我不是身體，因爲我可以看到它躺在那裏，那麼我是誰？這就是他詢問的開始。那麼，他14歲時是怎麼到那裏的呢？有很多人在14歲時，什麼都沒有發生。有一些東西在過去。當我說年輕的時候，我的意思是在生活中相當早。-這就是我的意思。-好吧。還有一件事，既然我們在說這個，你永遠不知道誰在這一生中達到了什麼程度，直到有事情發生。有時你會發現一個人可能是30-40歲的人，參與了你不喜歡的事情。可怕的事情。然後有一天他醒了，他意識到，啊，這不是我的目的。然後他就回去了。爲什麼？因爲正如克里希納在《薄迦梵歌》中對阿朱納說的那樣，無論你做了什麼靈性修行，它都在那裏，就像你的銀行餘額一樣，無論你來了多少世。它就在那裏。你不必從原點開始，從第二、第三、你離開的地方開始。你還記得關於克里希納時代的出生嗎？書裏有。這有點......我有點不好意思說那是一個女性的身體，等等，所以。-好的。 -是的。 -你可以生爲女性或男性？-靈魂沒有性別。爲什麼靈魂會選擇生爲男性或女性，這取決於它需要收集什麼經驗。兩者有不同的經驗？是的，一般來說。是的，當然了。如果男性和女性在生活中面對同樣的情況，你會看到有兩種不同的反應，荷爾蒙的不同，各種事情。你想對那些出生在變性人身體裏的人做一些說明嗎？是的，當然了。這是一種荷爾蒙的一些混合情況，人們既不在這裏也不在那裏。每個人都有男性和女性荷爾蒙。這是衆所周知的。對於一些人來說，女性荷爾蒙更多，所以他們是女性。對有些人來說，男性荷爾蒙更多，所以他們是男人。就是這樣。但有時它......看，這不是一個新的東西。溼婆本人，他的主要表現之一是Ardhanarishvara，這意味着一半是男性，一半是女性。因此，這意味着某些特徵，如藝術、文學，諸如此類的東西，它們更多體現在人類的女性方面。而身體力量的串聯和去獲得之類的東西，它們來自男性方面。即使你的荷爾蒙是平衡的，你生爲男性或作爲女性，在某種程度上發展相反的特質也是一個好主意。爲了平衡？爲了平衡。所以現在，例如，在瑜伽、克里雅和任何其他瑜伽、調息法中，我們知道有伊達和平加拉。你必須說明背景，先生。Ida是指從大腦流向你的左側的納迪，而Pingala從右側流向左側。這就像一條星際神經。對嗎？但它對應於......納迪對應於副交感神經系統和迷走神經，後者控制心臟、肺，等等。它們是，但實際上，我們談論的是一種精神能量，而不是一種物理能量。明白了，所以在肉體中，-應該是你的迷走神經。-完全正確，迷走神經。-它實際上有星空的意義。-是的 -是的 -好的，所以當你說納迪的時候，我們實際上指的是兩者。-交感神經和副交感神經？-是的，而且普拉納在這兩方面都起作用。右側的艾達納迪被稱爲冷納迪。事實上，它是女性的系統。而右邊的被稱爲平伽羅納迪，是正的。當我說加號和減號時。不是以壞的方式，減去，而是相反，就像陰極和陽極，讓我們說。所以你不能說這個少，那個多。沒有兩者，你就不能做任何事情。-是的。 -所以在練習調息法的時候，我們試圖平衡這兩者。所以這就是爲什麼他們要做所謂的Anulom Vilom。用一個鼻孔吸氣，用另一個鼻孔吸氣。Anulom Vilom，從左邊進去，保持一會兒，從右邊呼出，吸到右邊，保持並從左邊出去。這被稱爲交替呼吸。這可以平衡你身體裏的正負值。而對於一個靈性的人來說，需要平衡這兩者。你需要這兩者。這就是爲什麼一些偉大的人，不是所有的，像拉姆克里希納-帕拉姆漢薩，斯瓦米-維韋卡南達的導師，每個人都知道斯瓦米。Chaitanya Mahaprabhu，他們做他們的sadhana，認爲自己是克里希納的妃子。但他們有男性的身體。他們不是變性人。他們有男性的身體。所以，思想是這樣工作的。看，所以對於不想過多地陷入這些情緒波動的瑜伽師來說，他們通過Anulom Vilom來平衡Ida和Pingala。通過Anulom Vilom的練習，我認爲這是前進的關鍵。-好的 -它平衡了納迪。說到這裏，我認爲，這兩種屬性或這兩種特徵都是人類的一部分，不管是男性還是女性，儘管在很多情況下，它可能不會以身體表現的方式公開可見。好吧，你在這一生中是否曾經愛上過一個人？
   在這一生中？是的，我有。這是在你的靈性旅程開始之後？首先，我愛上了Maheshwarnath Babaji，我的主人。我的意思是，愛並不意味着僅僅是身體上的。不，像浪漫的愛。浪漫的愛，在我結婚之前，我和我的妻子有一點兒。但這是在你的精神旅程之後。靈性的成長是否會-減少浪漫的數量？-不會。 -你仍然可以成爲沙魯克汗。-當然了。-好的。 -我知道，我不能成爲沙魯克-汗。而且我不知道他有多浪漫。我真的不知道。但你在電影中看到的也可能不是事實， -是的。 -這我們不能說。但是我想可能在某個地方有一個誤解，認爲如果你是精神的，你的心就會變成石頭。不，事實上，你的心變得更敏感，也許更無私，但更敏感。所以像愛情、親情這樣的情感，所有這些東西都很常見。依戀可能不存在。依戀是當你迷戀上某樣東西的時候。所以當你說依戀不存在的時候。這意味着你並不完全依賴那個。看，依戀是一個依賴性的問題。愛不需要依賴。-好的。 -可以是自由的。好的。即使是浪漫的愛？-是的，是的。絕對的。-就像即使他們走了，我也會讓他們走，-因爲我愛他們。-是的，沒錯。也許他們更喜歡別人。-爲什麼，爲什麼，先生？-誰知道呢？沒關係的。不，不，我是在開玩笑。好吧。給你提個簡單的問題。你認爲你妻子的前世是什麼，纔會和你這個今生幾乎是現代身體的聖人在一起？她做了什麼善事或一般的什麼因果，纔有你這個丈夫？我可以這樣說嗎？因爲她可能會看播客，也許我做了什麼好的業力來和她在一起？-是的。 -這樣說吧。實際上，我不知道。我沒有深入研究過她的前世。查閱別人的前世是不允許的。這就像閱讀私人信件一樣。一定有什麼東西讓她最終與......有時人們會說像我這樣的瘋子，並因此經歷了很多困難。因爲我從來不在那裏。我去了這裏，我去了那裏。她說，好吧，他的生活就是這樣的，他是平衡的，這表明了精神成熟的跡象。有些東西是存在的，否則不可能。我知道有很多人說，哦，我們愛你，先生，但這是不同的。好吧，她也是靈性的嗎？靈性的，但她做她的瑜伽。她是一個很好的人。她是一個素食主義者。她不喜歡買東西，不喜歡囤積，這些東西都不喜歡。而且她是一個非常善良的人。如果那是靈性的話。是的，她是。所以除了冥想、唸佛、祈禱之外，還有不同的活動決定了你的靈性--或不靈性。-就像服務一樣。除了我的妻子，我遇到的人說，我們不相信所有這些靈性，上帝的東西，以及所有，但我們相信人類的本質是真正的好。有東西在掩蓋他們的感情。所以他們的行爲是這樣的。而我們喜歡爲人類服務。他們說，我們喜歡爲人類服務。我們不相信你所說的這些精神上的東西。但是我們爲不幸的人類做服務。我認爲這也是精神成熟的一個標誌。在他們過去的生活中，有些東西把他們帶到了那個階段，他們能夠做無私的工作，幫助人類。這樣的人，我個人認爲過了一段時間，他們會自動地、自然地對靈性的東西感興趣，因爲心靈正在得到淨化。有的人有薩特瓦古納。我想談談你和你師父在一起的頭幾天，因爲我假設在你真正開始和他冥想的那個階段之前，你並沒有太多冥想。是的。最初幾天的訓練是什麼樣的？我不知道你是否可以稱之爲訓練，但我假設有一些事情，他讓你做，一些可能淨化你的活動。這就是我們開始創作上一集的續集的地方。那一集的幾個關鍵術語--是高級生命，Yeti，Sri M，Babaji。-是的。所以讓我們再次從這個切入點開始。看，是這樣的。我在打坐。我不會說我沒有在冥想，但我不知道到底該如何去做。我在用自己的方式做，就像許多年輕人感興趣的那樣，我曾經在日落時分坐了一段時間，閉上眼睛。在8歲的時候，Babaji遇見了我並把他的手放在我的頭上，之後我就不正常了。我的意思是，我做了年輕人在學校和大學所做的一切。但我心中有一部分是冥想的，它在尋找如何獲得更多關於這些事情的知識，與人會面，所有這些都已經發生了。這並不是說它沒有發生。當我第一次再次見到巴巴吉的身體時，我的意思是，這只是五分鐘而已。那時我8歲。當我開始和他一起生活時，他讓我進入某種冥想路線，比如你應該冥想多少次，多少個小時。然後他教我Kriya。教我如何練習Kriya。談到克里雅瑜伽，我們的很多聽衆都讀過《一個瑜伽士的自傳》，其中克里雅瑜伽被說成是一種非常快速的精神進步的方式。但我相信，你的身體也需要某種熱身才能達到這一點。-是的。 -正確嗎？我告訴過你，我想，我記得上次對你說過。在精神旅程中，沒有噴氣式飛機的路徑。一切都是艱苦的工作。我們需要，我是說，人們已經說過了。-但我並不完全贊同這一點。-好吧。僅僅因爲你參加了克里雅，你就不應該認爲我是，現在我是，不是。需要有許多準備工作。你需要調整你的情緒，你的感情。必須遵循Yama Niyamas。然後當你完成這些後，也要看你做了多少克里雅。如果你要求普通的、正常的人坐下來，現在每天做3個小時的這個，這是不可能的。所以你需要慢慢來。所以我從半小時開始。巴巴吉是這方面的專家。他首先告訴我半小時，然後你做1小時，然後45分鐘，1小時，像這樣。有一段時間，我在冥想--幾乎每天6小時。6個小時，意思是，做Kriya大約3-4個小時。3個小時，然後默默地打坐。對所有克里雅修行者來說，非常重要的是，在做完技術後，你必須默默地冥想一段時間。而對我來說，默唸時間開始增加。因爲當你做克里雅時，你會沉浸在內心，你開始享受它。冥想的最後一部分是讓自己不做任何事就享受它。不念咒語或什麼？什麼都不做。這叫做純粹的Sakshi。這意味着見證。再次，讓我給聽衆一些背景，因爲很多人把冥想與他們所學的一些西方技術聯繫起來。而這些也很好。但它是關於專注於你的呼吸，專注於你周圍的聲音。當你在談論克里雅或克里雅相關的冥想時，有一種非常特別的技術。它可能是與呼吸或咒語有關的東西，它是。-它把你推到一個非常深的狀態。-正是如此。這是一種基於焦點的技術。但是當你從裏面出來的時候，有一些方法可以讓你出來，你需要花一些時間靜靜地吸收......看，我說不出來了。只是吸收你的身體所看到的東西。非常重要。這是非常重要的。在最後，這必須要做。所以我就這麼做了。然後，巴巴吉總是旅行。他從不在一個地方停留很長時間。所以他從一個地方到另一個地方旅行。他總是步行前往。所以我也和他一起走。沒有出路。每當他發現一個好的、偉大的瑜伽師或有......有時，他常常帶我去見一些人，今天我不認爲他們是偉大的瑜伽師。那時候，我就會上當受騙。他們有一些能力，比如說他們使用一些sidhis，他們曾經做過一些事情。通常我都會上當。巴巴吉總是提醒我。這還不是旅程的終點。我不會在這部分告訴你。這很有意思。許多人過來說，我可以擁有這個側身，那個側身嗎？在阿斯湯加瑜伽中，有ashta sidhis。而《瑜伽經》也可以，我只是告訴他們，看，這不是你練習的目的。是的。當你在路上練習時，你可能會遇到這樣的事情。但它們是無用的前進。它們是對最終目標的分心。我必須告訴你這一點。不是人們說，哦，這是因爲你不能做你所說的任何事情。對不起，我說，不是這樣的。所以這個拉瑪克里希納-帕拉曼薩有一位大師，他有很多大師。他的一位大師是Bhairavi Brahmani，她是一位女士，據說是Trailanga Swami大帝的弟子，他的三昧真火在Banaras。她向他傳授了《吠舍那瓦經》，然後她就走了。許多年後，拉瑪克里希納的兩位導師Bhais，其中一位的名字是Manikandan。他回來後遇到了羅摩克里希納。他經常叫他Gadadhar，因爲他們彼此認識。他說......拉瑪克里希納有一個習慣，在深夜，半夜走到Panchavati，在Dakshineswar附近的五棵樹羣中，在半夜冥想。他必須帶着燈籠去。所以有一天，馬尼坎丹說，嘿，大師，你不需要燈籠了。他說爲什麼？他說，因爲我這裏有一盞燈。好吧，我可以爲你放上那盞燈。故事是，他打開他的，不管是什麼，顯示了一盞燈。拉瑪克里希納就去冥想，然後回來了。回來後，拉瑪克里希納對他說，你可能認爲我沒有這些能力。不要緊，我不感興趣。但是這對你沒有好處。從明天起，你不能使用這道光。它已經消失了，它已經消失了。爲什麼這對他沒有好處？在夜裏亮出燈光有什麼用？所以他將一個火把。就這麼簡單。你必須要做更多的事情。所以我看到了很多偉大的瑜伽師類型和所有。我沒有... 巴布吉還向我解釋了這些東西如何運作的原理。如果你練習某些東西，它們並不是什麼大問題，和我一起練習6天、7天，你也可以做這些事情。這不是什麼大問題。我什麼時候能見到你，先生？不，不。我是在開玩笑。比如說，我去了Lakshman Jhula。在那裏，在山的後面，有一個瑜伽士，尼泊爾的瑜伽士。這裏是瑞詩凱詩。在瑞詩凱詩之外。Devprayag。巴吉拉蒂河和曼達基尼河的交匯處。-好吧，所以我去了那裏。這個瑜伽士說，他說，看我能做這個，這個，這個，這個。所以，巴巴吉在笑。他說，"sun le kuch mat bolna"。他說，聽着，不要說什麼。然後他說，看這裏，我的手在這裏。他像這樣展示。我的手在這裏。看，看這裏。所以他說，這裏，像這樣。然後他就像這樣做了。然後他拿出一個如來佛像。他說，這個我......然後他說，這是從哪裏來的？
   我可以把它給你。它不會消失。你可以永遠保留它。把它放在你的脖子上。你想把它放在你的脖子裏嗎？不，事後。像這樣，你所擁有的。哦，我的上帝。如果你願意，那我就給你開個洞。我只是要給聽衆一些背景。我可以在這上面給一個洞，這樣你就可以使用它了嗎？是的，先生。放一根繩子。-是的 -我的上帝 好的。 -這是在攝像機上？-我不知道。它被拍到了... ...對於音頻聽衆來說，在鏡頭裏，我們只是，一個如來神掌憑空產生了。它聞起來非常好。你想看看嗎？這是我的榮幸。聞一聞。-我的上帝。-很好。所以我的意思是說，我已經看到了這一切。但我不認爲這是一個大問題。這不是什麼大問題。你跟我一起去。呆上9天。你也會做，我爲什麼要這樣做？只是想告訴你，這不是什麼大問題。這不是我們的目標。我有點無語了。很抱歉，好吧。產生灰燼。生產......看看會發生什麼？人們走神了，離開了，然後他們總是期待這個事情的發生。我在說，所以我看了這一切。那是我精神的一部分......既然你問我關於精神訓練的問題，我被帶到所有這些人那裏，給他們看所有這些東西，然後說，看，這不是它。深入冥想。去找你的內在本質。所以這就是訓練的一部分。-要超越分心。-是的。而這並沒有什麼。看，這個如來神掌不是憑空產生的。讓我把它。它在某個地方。但我有機構可以把它們帶到這裏。那是不同的。不是物理機構。更高的生命？不管是什麼，高級的、低級的、小夥伴們。我想說的是，這並不是什麼大事。你不必是高度靈性的人也能做到這一點。我見過一些可怕的人，但他們有這樣的能力。Karna Pishachini之類的。他們說它在跟我說話。它在告訴我你的生活和事情，而人們都上當了。哇。好吧，現在有這麼多想法。我想問的是，先生，現在世界上發生了什麼？還有，你爲什麼，你爲什麼會出現在播客上？你能保證這個安全嗎？它在我這裏。好的，這對我來說非常重要。世界上發生了什麼，爲什麼我在播客上？好吧，我告訴你這個問題的來源。即使在3年前4年前，我也不敢做播客--像這樣。-正確。-我只是覺得觀衆還沒有準備好。-對。現在出現的問題和被觀衆接受的問題是不同的。大流行之後。另外，我們看到世界上有戰爭，我們看到世界上有地震。-這不是一個正常的十年。-是真的。正在發生什麼？我們又將走向何方？人類將走向何方？最悲哀的消息是，在Joshimath出現了裂縫。-是的 -是嗎？現在，這些裂縫，如果它們延伸到Badri，會發生什麼？所以所發生的事情是人類濫用了自然。從環境上來說，它處於非常糟糕的狀態。你可以修建高速公路去Badrinath。但這並不是全部。喜馬拉雅山的生態系統是如此的敏感，如此的，它位於斷層線上。所以我們必須非常小心地處理這個問題。這不僅僅是擁有高速公路。好吧，我理解。這對人們來說更容易。他們說，哦，瑞士有高速公路，但瑞士的阿爾卑斯山並不位於斷層上。所以我有一種感覺，現在人們看到這種情況發生的洪水，海平面在上升，冰山在融化。人類的殘忍行爲普遍在增加。各種各樣的事情都在發生。當然，也有一面是精神上的，是的。所以我認爲年輕人也已經開始思考，因爲未來屬於年輕人，開始思考這不是一切。一定有更多的東西在裏面。-比如說精神。-肯定是的。因爲我們印度人很幸運，因爲我們已經接觸它這麼多年了，而其他人可能不是這樣。所以人們已經開始思考，是否有比這更多的東西？這就是全部嗎？我們是否會在地震或發生什麼事情後突然死亡？最近在土耳其有多少人死亡？所以所有這些災難都是一個指向，說，嗯，這不是全部。還有比這更多的東西，它永遠無法被創造或摧毀。因此，當年輕人開始研究這個問題並尋找它時，像你這樣的播客是很重要的。所以我同意來做這個，因爲我想爲這些人提供某種聯繫。他們在這裏徘徊，在那裏徘徊。你的師父有沒有告訴你，困難時期會到來？是的，他說過。而且他說的許多事情現在正在發生。在那個時候，我曾經想，也許有些事情會發生，有些可能不會發生，但他說的很多事情正在發生。海平面上升。當他說這句話時，我無法相信，在那個時候。他說南極洲的冰會融化。他說，喜馬拉雅山會有地震。我說，那是一個神聖的地方。他說，是的，但它仍然是一個物理系統。它可以發生。今天，這件事。他還說，這是一個積極的事情，年輕人會對精神問題感興趣。這是一個非常重要的、積極的看法。他說年輕人也會對精神事務感興趣，這對防止未來的災難很重要。他說，他們是接下來要接管這個世界的人。他們帶着這樣的理解和背景去是很好的，這就是爲什麼我也試圖把精力放在年輕人身上。我去參加Satsangs，當我看到更多的年輕人，我真的很高興，因爲我認爲我在做我的工作。他還說，既然我們在討論這個問題，有一天，會有成千上萬的人在聽你講話。所以要做好準備。要有實質內容與他們交談。這是否簽署了--對人類來說是一個困難的十年？-是的。 -20年代？-對人類來說非常困難的十年。但是一旦我們跨過這個坎，我們會走得更好。這是一個改造所。淨化？印度在這十年中是否有非常非常大的作用？印度在這十年裏有一個非常重要的作用。不是像人們說的那樣，只是在經濟方面等等，而是從精神覺醒和理解的角度。現在，當你說精神的時候，不要把它僅僅等同於宗教。當我說精神的時候，研究事物的來源，研究外部世界的來源，以及內在世界的來源，這些都是非常科學的東西。而在我們印度的傳統中，精神內容非常好，人們可以研究這些並找到答案。比如說，吠陀的數學。今天，計算機在1和0上運行。誰發明了零的概念，Shunya？我認識一個人，他是......我不完全同意他的許多事情。他是一個非常正統的人，是個好人，是一個突厥人的頭，等等。很多人不知道這個人，他們認爲他是個無知的人。所以他是這樣說話的。他寫了28本關於吠陀數學的書，因爲他不會來參加播客，我肯定。我不知道，除非你能，但這樣的事情是我們永恆傳統的一部分，我們現在談論它很重要。世界也開始意識到了。看看有多少外國人來了，在這裏尋找各種東西。我不知道我是否應該問你這個問題。我問你這個問題是因爲我實際上已經在鏡頭外問了很多軍人這個問題。按照你的說法，世界是否正在爲一場世界大戰式的局勢做準備？幸運的是，世界戰爭不會被允許發生。即使它以某種方式開始，他們也會終止它。因爲如果發生世界大戰，總是會有核戰爭。沒有人能夠負擔得起核戰爭，所以我認爲這不會發生。好吧，好吧。但情況可能看起來正朝着這個方向發展，這是個好跡象。我們應該從這裏開始改變。我有點被嚇到了--因爲這個回答很誠實。-對不起。我不應該到最後才說...不，不，先生。這個話題出現了，所以我... ... 不，我真的很感激。有一件事我將非常原始和誠實地告訴你。我遇到很多13、14歲的孩子，他們現在已經開始看這個節目了。-這讓我覺得很奇怪。-爲什麼？不錯。我做這個工作已經八年了，我一直在給這些視頻，而不是播客。在播客之前，我曾經制作過視頻。我曾經給它我200%的努力，但只有八年下來，現在，我接觸到了更多的觀衆。對，對。而他們進入這個節目的原因是與鬼魂和恐怖有關的視頻。我不會撒謊，我做這些劇集是爲了接觸更多的觀衆。雖然在我心裏，我是爲了這樣的劇集而做的。-我們談的是更高的概念。-對，對。昨天我遇到了一羣14歲的孩子，穿得很好，很酷的傢伙，我去找他們，我就說，你看什麼視頻？我以爲他們會說，時尚視頻。他們說，不，我們看你的精神方面的東西。我當時想，你才13歲，你才14歲。你怎麼會看精神方面的東西？但後來這對我來說也是一個好兆頭。現在，我要問你的問題，先生，是與恐怖有關的東西。-恐怖？-是的。對於實際上抓緊更多的13，14歲的孩子。這些人是先進的靈魂，就像這羣孩子，因爲他們知道的東西比我們13-14歲時知道的要多。是的，現在來的年輕的人，有些已經來了。有些人正在來。即使是比我年輕的一代，他們中的一些人至少是成熟的靈魂，他們是爲了一個目的而來。甚至智商也比我們那個年齡段的時候好得多。-是的 -不是你，是我，這是個好跡象。這意味着我們正在進化。我們正在成爲人類，現在。曾幾何時，進化意味着科學、物質、經濟。現在我們正在從額葉文明中走出來，進入不同的東西。許多年輕人的大腦中研究這些問題的部分被激活。所以他們會在那裏提出問題。我現在家裏有一個，他看起來非常好奇，但我認爲他過了一段時間就會問我這些問題。我現在有一個孫子，他兩歲了，他常用的詞，任何東西都是不，Neti。不是這個，不是這個。就像Shankara說的Neti。而最近他纔開始學習說Yeah，但直到現在他還在說no。因此，當我看着他時，我看到他的頭腦是非常好奇的。這不是因爲，他是我的孫子。而是我見過很多這樣的年輕人。昨天我遇到一個年輕女孩，她告訴她的母親，嘿，你應該開始打坐。你知道她多大了嗎？
   昨天她在那裏結婚，已經去參加婚禮了。四年了。四年半了。腦子裏的東西是從哪裏來的？-它儲存在某個地方。-是的。我在說這個，在一開始我曾經去做這個的時候。我們有Shibhir，這意味着在不同地方的閉關。這是一個爲期2-1/2天的閉關。而在最後，我給克里雅。所以，我們有一個規定，12歲以下的人不給克里雅。有些年頭，從4年前開始，3年前，人們開始帶着12歲的孩子。嘿，他們太小了。他們剛過12歲。你說12歲就可以了。而現在這種情況正在增加。因爲孩子們告訴他們的爸爸媽媽，我們也想參加克里雅，爲什麼只有你？這在以前從未發生過。-我把它和你說的聯繫起來。-是的。一羣年輕人說，我們在聽精神視頻。你到底是怎麼想的？因爲在那個年齡段，通常人是不會看這個的。-是的。 -所以新一代，雖然一方面是一組，在某種意義上有點太破壞性。也有另一撥人出現了，他們在這個問題上很有創造力？-吉尼奧斯。我認爲他們會平衡。我們有一個非常高級的密宗修行者在節目中，我感覺到他在節目中的存在，他的名字是Rajarshi Nandi。他的到來有兩個原因。第一，有點類似於你來的原因。在一個公共平臺上談論這些事情，最後。奇怪的是，他是在Kaal Bhairav Jayanti來的，在那一天來的，他和我們一起錄製了大約五集不可思議的節目。人們對這些情節真的失去了理智。因爲他說的那種東西，一般來說，互聯網沒有這種內容。第二，他改變了我的道路。他回答了許多其他人無法回答的問題。只有兩個人能夠準確回答這些問題，那就是你和他。他的名字是Rajarshi Nandi。我想問你關於密宗的問題，以及它在靈性道路上的地位。我對它的理解是，首先，它不適合所有人。它確實有兇猛的一面。但是，如果你逐漸被引導，它將使你的道路更加快速。但這不完全是你應該進入它的原因。你想稍微強調一下密宗嗎？因爲當我告訴我母親我已經開始做一些咒語時，她會說，這都是什麼？第一次，是關於鬼的。現在你開始接觸密宗了。但我並不把它看成是一件負面的事情。在某種程度上，這個密宗已經獲得了一個非常糟糕的名字，通常是因爲人們只把密宗與阿戈里人聯繫在一起，或與住在smashans的人聯繫在一起，或與那些喝酒和有各種狂歡的人聯繫在一起。這就是密宗所呈現的畫面。但實際上，密宗不僅僅是......看，首先我們必須理解Yantra、Mantra、Tantra這個詞。Yantra是一種圖示。-密宗是一張圖？-密宗。-密宗是一種圖表。-是一個圖。咒語是激活該機器的聲音。Yantra也意味着一臺機器。你知道這一點。那樣的水晶會是一個Yantra嗎？可能是。一個物體？物體，但它應該有一些信號，通過這些信號它可以吸引力量。一個符號。這就是所謂的Yantra。-好的。 -圖示，就是Yantra。而咒語是激活裏面的能量的東西。而密宗是兩者的結合。好，現在的意思是--現在你也應該明白，當你說密宗時，傳統上有兩個部分。一個叫Kaulachara或左手道，Vamachara。而另一個是Samaya Marga。兩條道路。寫《聲聞緣覺》的Adi Shankara是一個Samaya Margi。他奉行的是右手道。不使用酒類。不使用任何Panchamakaras。-你知道什麼是Panchamakaras？-是的，是的。它們不被使用。因爲它們都是通過冥想等方式在體內產生的。艱難的道路。瓦馬查拉認爲，人類，我們大多數人，被歸類爲Pashu級別，這意味着仍然是動物。我們不能直接，放棄一切，突然去到高的精神層次。這隻有少數有天賦的人或有這種背景的人才能做到。那其他的人呢？雖然他們說享受和前進。這就是密宗。所以密宗使用的關鍵詞，口號是Yogo Bhogo Yogayate。這意味着瑜伽是Bhoga。Bhoga是享受。所以當你做瑜伽時，會發生什麼？你在內部享受。當你的昆達利尼被喚醒時。它從哪裏覺醒？從Muladhara。Muladhara在哪裏？就在你的生殖器官後面。這也是往下流的能量。那個人有性享受。真正瞭解密宗的人已經學會了如何激活這種能量，使它也向上提升。有時它也可以通過行爲發生，這就是爲什麼密宗會有這個壞名聲。但這必須在適當的指導下非常謹慎地進行。否則，你就會像其他身體行爲一樣結束。一個人必須學會如何做Khechari。一個人應該知道如何進行Vajroli，如何不讓能量消失，而是保持它。因此，我的意思是，這是一個複雜的話題，我想說的是，在密宗裏有兩個部分。左手的路徑。左手道利用五種馬卡拉斯，因爲他們認爲人類不能放棄一切，只能通過享受而去，然後慢慢地，慢慢地向前走。Panchamakaras的意思是五個女士，Makara是M字母。它是matsya、maṃsa、madu也就是madya、maithuna，還忘了還有一個。-它基本上是收益。-穀物，穀物，是的。-穀物、魚、肉、酒、性。-是的。所以他們想做的是，用這個來昇華思想。不是爲了留在那裏，而是爲了昇華思想。所以，這部分，Kaulachara，它也被稱爲。在克什米爾的所有考爾人都來自於此，你看。但這並不意味着它僅僅是一種，它被稱爲什麼？派對一類的東西，密宗。這是一個非常嚴肅的事情。如果有合適的老師，一個人絕對可以練習。現在，既然我們在討論這個問題，我希望你能清楚地瞭解密宗的情況，這將需要很多這樣的情節，也許。所以我建議，幸運的是，有一篇美麗的文字已經被翻譯成英文。它是由一個叫阿瑟-阿瓦隆的人寫的，他還寫了《蛇力》。蛇的力量》是關於昆達利尼的。他寫的《蛇的力量》，實際上是對普南達-瑜伽師的《Shat-Chakra-Nirupana》的翻譯。對六個脈輪的描述。所以阿瑟-阿瓦隆是--他的名字實際上是約翰-伍德羅夫爵士。對每個人來說，瞭解密宗是件好事。特別是對觀衆來說。他是加爾各答高等法院的一名法官。他是一個英國人。所以，約翰-伍德羅夫對密宗非常感興趣，後來他辭去了高等法院的職務，與密宗的人在一起。而孟加拉是一個非常好的密宗中心。所以，在研究的基礎上--在研究密宗教科書多於研究實踐方面的基礎上，他寫了一本很好的書，叫做《密宗入門》。我想你應該讀一讀。-介紹？-是的，《密宗入門》。-好的。-還有一些其他的書，是技術性的。沒有必要去了解這些。還有Shat-Chakra-Nirupana，也就是《蛇力》。這兩本書。這將使你對什麼是密宗有一個完整的瞭解，以及你可以依靠哪些教科書來理解密宗。這樣就可以擺脫這種想法，即密宗只是鬼怪，而你知道所有這些。因爲我知道很多聽衆都是爲此而聽這一集的。我從拉賈什的那一集學到的一件事是，當你的路向前走時，當然會有一些力量試圖把你拉回來。當然，這些力量可能在其他人的思想和心裏，他們懷疑你，他們說，--不，不，你不會做得到的。-絕對的。但它實際上也可能是更黑暗的力量。有時可能是更黑暗的力量在影響那些人，把你拉回來。可能的。我想知道關於這整個黑暗的方面，這有點像精神成長的對立面。我能說點什麼嗎？當然，先生。當你開始思考或將你的思想應用於此的時候，他們的存在就會變得更加強大。最好是用其他東西和積極的東西，這樣它們就沒有時間進入。好的。你不願意因爲同樣的原因而談論它嗎？-是的。 -好的。理解了。這是巴巴吉教我的。當你討論這些事情時，它們都在那裏。從那裏面出來。討論更高一級的善人，他們就不在那裏。好吧，好吧。我將問你一個迫切的問題--那麼，我已經保存到最後了。-當然。 -我是不是做錯了什麼。-不，不。在我的生活中，在互聯網上談論那些黑暗的東西？不，不，不。我說的是原則，基本原則是，當你在談論它們時，它們的存在就在那裏。但是在這裏你不需要擔心。我在那裏，哪個是... 你曾經處理過這些事情？是的。我有時是這樣。我在我的傳記中也寫過，在一些地方，我提到過。我有時不得不進行艱苦的鬥爭。-現在也是嗎？-不，不。 -現在，他們不靠近？-從遠處。因爲已經有更高的生命和你在一起了。-是的。 -好吧。而這實際上是這些人之間的鬥爭--不僅是因爲有更高的生命，而且現在他們把我看成是更高的生命。最後一個問題要問你，先生。在今天的節目中，你對我有什麼建議？我認爲你應該繼續做你正在做的事情。好的工作。除此以外，也要爲自己制定一個個人悲願的常規。-好的。 -某種個人的唸佛。我想你可能正在做。但如果你沒有，那麼最好開始一些安靜的冥想，一些sadhana，Hamsa，我們在Kriya瑜伽中所說的。你應該每天都這樣做，這樣明天你可能會更好地理解事情，甚至當你和這個領域的其他人交談時，以及爲了你個人的精神成長。除此以外，你所做的這是一件很好的事情。-這些對話？-是的。因爲很多人知道了他們在互聯網上不會知道的事情。這也是一種服務嗎？-我想這是一種服務。-好吧。當然，從我的角度來看，這也是一種服務。看，我可以說話。我可以舉行Satsangs。但那不會有像這樣的影響力。既然我們現在在一起談話，有多少人會知道，對嗎？這樣你就在爲巴巴吉做服務，而不僅僅是爲我。你是在讓我更好地做我的工作，實際上。有時你需要問題來塑造。-當然了。-想法。你應該始終敞開問題。這種你不應該問問題，你不應該懷疑的想法，我認爲它們出現得更晚。在開始時，即使是創世的第一首讚美詩也是以 "也許他在高處知道，也許他不知道 "來結束。沒有懷疑，沒有質疑，你就無法探索任何東西。最後一個問題，先生，給你。我心裏有一個強烈的願望，幾乎現在就要開始，放棄物質生活。這只是突然出現的，可能是在去年。也許我看到了像物質主義的高峯。而我所說的物質主義是指一切的存在。當我的職業生涯開始時，我所希望的一切。我想要錢，我想要名聲，我想要公衆認可。三者都經歷了。我確實有一部分人現在想離開，只專注於唸佛。而這將意味着停止表演，也許。這將意味着停止優酷網，離開名聲。你能嗎？
   你能......就像《博伽梵歌》一樣，留在戰場上，繼續你的精神......好吧，Kurukshetra。這都是Kurukshetra。所以考慮一下，你在做一件好事，你不是隻爲了名字、名聲等等。名字、名聲都是必要的，以使其流行等等。現在你不需要做任何這樣的事情。你只需自然地做你想到的事情。你就會做得很好。那麼，爲什麼你會退出，然後再進去呢？這是個心態的問題。-理解和環境。-還有。斯里姆，先生。謝謝你。只是我的意思是，對你表示感謝。-感謝那些高高在上的衆生。-不管是誰。在這個中給了你答案。謝謝那些給我問題的高人。這就是全部，我要說的。我只是非常感激我能夠與像你這樣的人交流。而且我------也許我們還會見面。-是的。我希望能很快見到你，先生。我希望我對這次談話做到了公正。我想是的。你應該找個時間來馬丹納帕爾。我打算這樣做。我打算這樣做。你應該這樣做。非常安靜的地方。是的。有很多像... ... 花一兩天時間安靜地生活。不用去採訪什麼。-或者也許我做。-那是由你決定的。但即使如此，你也可以只是來，花一些安靜的時間，-看看我們在做什麼。-是的。現在有很多動盪的事情。我注意到的一件事是，生活是一個持續的過程，看到動盪，然後看到和平的階段。所以對我來說，這是非常重要的談話。我想說謝謝你，還有很多其他的事情--這些都包含在這一句謝謝里。-謝謝你。謝謝你，先生。所以這就是今天的節目。你看到我錄製的空間，特別是如果你看到這個播客的視頻版本，這是我們的臨時空間，因爲我們目前的空間正在裝修。我確實相信，當你與像Sri M這樣的精神大師進行這種對話時，如果你與他們交談這麼久，如果你提取他們的知識，如果你甚至簡單地邀請他們進入一個空間，整個空間都會得到祝福。整個空間的能量都會改變。我甚至可以說，當涉及到一些在精神上如此先進的人，比如Sri M，即使你聽他們的播客，當你聽到他們的聲音，有一定的能量和平靜會在你的房間裏傳播。如果你用揚聲器聽這個，在你的腦海中，如果你用耳機或頭戴式耳機聽這個，這就是爲你創造這些情節的真正樂趣。還有很多東西要從喜馬拉雅大師那裏學習。肯定會很快做一個印地語集。我確實建議你們看看我們的印地語播客。它同樣有靈性，同樣有味道，但更多一點情感。請確保你去看看。請確保你在Spotify上關注我們。每一集都可以在Spotify上看到，比世界上其他地方的節目早48小時。最後，如果你想開始你自己的冥想之旅，我的冥想應用程序現在已經在App Store和Play Store上線。我把它鏈接在下面。初學者，中級者，高級冥想者，這就是它的意義所在。給你們很多愛。我把我對你們心靈成長的真實願望送給你們。我希望這些播客能繼續爲你們提供動力。很多的愛。🎶[音樂]🎶
