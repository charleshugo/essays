[Music] when we meet people who have been through difficult life experiences you will notice how some people came out stronger from their struggles with resilience and self-discipline on the other hand you will also see people who get stuck don't want to do anything who eventually gave up on their goals and became bitter and resentful and if you're like me are curious about what makes some people so irritated by the reality of life then this video may help you shed some light on the matter a well-known clinical psychologist jordan peterson believes that morally weak people are more likely to display this behavior a person is said to be a morally weak if while accepting a moral principle he fails to perform a specific action even though it is possible for him to do so in simple words if you are unable to provide for yourself then someone else must do on your behalf and this is not a healthy sign because if you are not honest with yourself about your current situation and do not chart your own course through life you will become aggressive because you are being hurt by the tragedy of existence you will seek vengeance wherever you can find it and it's bad for you it's bad for your family and it's bad for your community in some cases if you are not respected by your child parents or partners you will reflect revenge on them because bitterness is a complex emotion and it includes feelings of disappointment of not knowing what to do with your life and if you haven't made friends with your anger if you haven't placed it you're actually more dangerous because the things will happen and they will happen in unexpected ways so if you ask how do one cultivate acting better today for a more successful tomorrow then according to jordan peterson suppose if you have a child and you love that child and you want that child to develop you assign them a task that they have a reasonable chance of succeeding at but it has to be difficult so you look at the child and say this is your ability level and here is one more thing you could do to go and improve your ability and now you must do the same to yourself you have to take stock of yourself with meditational exercises of who am i and what are my flaws but the problem with asking ourselves is that you will get an answer that you do not want to hear therefore you have to ask yourself what small thing could someone as i do that would improve me even though it will be humiliating but when you make that small improvement you will notice that small improvements starts to compound and you will be moving ahead very very rapidly with the succession of small improvements a 17 year old boy whose father died unexpectedly wrote 200 word eulogy and was the strongest person at his father's funeral to help his mother despite feeling shocked horrified and hurt by witnessing his own father's death he did everything he could to keep it from getting any worse than it had to be and got through it this is a great example of how you can put yourself together to a staggering degree because it takes courage to admit that you are vulnerable because it's not form of weakness but it leads you to take whatever steps are necessary to deal with that properly because no one is invulnerable by any stretch of the imagination and standing up and facing it is the best route that you have because the greatest tragedy in life is not death but a life without a purpose i hope you found this video informative thumbs up if you did thumbs down if you didn't subscribe to support this channel and i'll see you next week with a new video cheers
