非常感謝你，艾倫，這是對李和讚美的搜索，我不可能做任何事情，除了反駁，但我仍然要介紹一些關於微笑的想法，這是我的標題來自彌爾頓的《失樂園》，他在其中描述了天堂裏的亞當和夏娃之間的愛情成長，以及通過微笑與對方的交流，他說："微笑來自理性的流動--"。換句話說，我們有自我意識的人可以微笑，而動物則不能，因爲我們可以微笑，所以我們以這種活動來滋養我們的互愛，這是我們的，這是一種人與人之間愛的增長方式，我認爲這是一個非常有趣的觀察，與我們的主題非常相關，它表明微笑是一種主體之間的關係，你知道我們已經在一個小小的小組討論中提出了這個問題，即自我是什麼以及這個想法 自我是人的那一方面，它與主觀性有關，是一個主體，而不是一個客體，對世界有一個觀點，而不是僅僅是世界上其他物品中的一個，這些都是困難的哲學思想，我不能說它們曾經被解釋得讓人滿意，但儘管如此，我們本能地理解它們，我們理解像我和你這樣的詞是把我們從自然界的普通流程中挑出來，把我們放到不同的角度。我們已經有了一個小例子，里爾克的著名詩作，由舒伯特的《你知道嗎》的設計和《消失》的設計，《你是平靜的》，它是寫給你的，好像她通過成爲他的愛的對象，從一切中脫穎而出，她是他一切的原因，也是實現它的東西，當然，舒伯特的設置非常清楚，這是一個非常特別的東西，這不是一個可以從第三世界描述的東西。這甚至不能從第三人稱的角度來描述 它必須從第一人稱或第二人稱的角度來描述 微笑是一件非常有趣的事情，是我們所做的事情 我認爲我們應該把微笑作爲人類面部的一般特徵 和對事物的微笑區分開來 在這個詞是非常難理解的 你知道只是微笑和對某人微笑有什麼區別嗎？也許那裏沒有人，但你仍然可以對他們微笑，因爲你認爲他們在那裏，我們製造了他們，你犯了一個錯誤，你可以對一個看不見的人或你記憶中的人微笑，所以這個詞at它有一個奇特的特點，哲學家稱之爲意向性，它的未來是向外的，不一定找到目標，就像它在世界中創造一個空間，可以容納其他東西，即使那裏沒有東西可以容納，這意味着存在着一種 這意味着存在錯誤的可能性，你可以對錯誤的人微笑，你知道，也許你的生命可能取決於此，有很多像這樣的錯誤，Ritesh稍後會提到，錯誤的可能性是將我們的心智狀態與大多數動物的心智狀態區分開來的事情之一，因爲我們建立在我們的心智狀態或對世界的概念上，並試圖使自己成爲這個概念的一部分，我說我們正在談論自拍想法 這似乎總是涉及到微笑 如果人們說以這種方式對着相機微笑 這就是樹的想法 你知道你不能站在相機前而不扭曲你的臉 以這種方式 沒有一個小動物可以毫無畏懼地面對它 它不是，如果你把它帶回它的生物起源 這顯然是譴責我們物種的事情之一 或者應該譴責它的滅絕 但出於某種原因，我們覺得這是絕對必要的 特別是當面對的是 這並不是在與任何人建立關係，而是我們認爲 至少這樣做的人認爲，我們只是在以某種方式展示自己是無害的，我們不是威脅 你知道，我們對兔子和其他動物是威脅，但我們對人類同胞不是威脅 但即使是政治家，現在也必須帶着微笑出現，所有照片或他們的公開照片都是微笑的照片，但他們真的在對什麼微笑嗎，這其實是一種微笑 如果你不是對着攝像機以外的東西笑的話 我想我們大多數人都會認爲對於普通的政治家來說 微笑是一種避開人們的方式，而不是與他們發生關係 這是一種在你的臉上蒙上面紗的方式，代表着你是一個普遍認同的人，但卻不能被打斷 這是個非常新的東西，照片必須這樣做 舊的攝影肖像的想法是，你以一種莊重的方式坐着，穿着得體，以便代表你是一個公民 作爲一個公民，作爲一個在生活中有地位的人 過去人們是這樣坐着拍照的 他們不假裝與相機有關係，更不假裝與相機後面的人有關係 很明顯，他們之間沒有什麼關係 他們表現的是普通人生活中的普通災難 我們在這裏，很抱歉我們沒能成功，但它就在這裏 所以你把你的社會意義發揮到了極致，但從任何形式的接觸中退縮了，沒有我與你的接觸 在現代社會中，我們沒有像這樣的東西 因爲我們總是看着鏡頭 我們不能真正呈現出那些社會意義上的姿勢 我們總是把自己引向鏡頭 所以如果我們想表現得嚴肅一點，或者看起來像 你知道我們有什麼可以提供的東西 這通常是一個佩爾特，而不是一個微笑 像這樣的性意義和撅嘴 在模特和流行明星的世界裏，這是你知道的 我們發現不笑的照片，但他的意義 但他的含義通常是略帶威脅性的，只有年輕人的流行團體，這是他們的正常姿態，這是他們與世界的關係，而那些在某種程度上是真誠的表達，是對他們的音樂的嚴肅真誠的表達，而不一定是對製作音樂的人的表達，所以讓我們回到或回到微笑，有兩種微笑，換句話說，他們是一般的微笑，對着鏡頭微笑可能是一個例子，對人微笑甚至動物看起來是 人們常說，這顯然與我們開始時的自拍沒有區別，但這隻狗當然不是對着另一個人笑，也不被理解爲笑，人們意識到了這一點，所以他們用這種方式來描繪微笑，正如你所看到的，那是動物能做的最好的微笑方式，它沒有對任何東西笑，我們也可以用這種方式在我們的臉上描繪微笑，這當然不是 我們也可以用這種方式在臉上畫笑臉 這當然不會讓人喜歡上化妝的人，但人們有時也會捲入其中 那麼米爾頓說來自理性的微笑是什麼意思呢？ 這是一個來自大教堂的天使，微笑的天使把全能者的祝福帶給了整個世界 這是不是真正的微笑呢？是他們人際關係的一部分，是他們看對方的方式的一部分，從他們的眼神中，他們之間的愛在增長，現在我認爲看另一個人是一個非常也非常有趣的現象，所有有眼睛的動物都在看東西，他們看東西是爲了收集信息，你知道他們對環境中的信息變化做出反應，但還有一種看，他們不能或似乎不能做，那就是看另一個人的眼睛。很多人想象他們的狗在渴望得到食物或其他東西時在看他們的眼睛，他們確實有一些穿透力強的方式來稱呼你，但他們不是在看你的眼睛，就像你看你愛的人的眼睛一樣，以便與他們交流你愛他們的事實，他們在看另一個人，這是一個非常奇怪的現象，約翰-多恩描述了這一點，他描述他和他的女主人坐在一起互相看着對方，那個小時 一小時 他和他的情婦坐在一起互相看着對方，一小時一小時的眼球扭曲，把我們的眼睛穿在一根雙線上，這種想法只是面對面地坐着，看着對方的眼睛，它們在你們之間成長，這種歸屬感，當你看着別人的眼睛時，在這種意義上，你不像一個驗光師，用一個小電筒看視網膜是否有一些損傷或類似的東西，你沒有任何東西要看，沒有物體要看，但這是關鍵的東西。沒有你想看到的物體，那麼你想看到的是什麼呢？ 那是主體，是你看不到的東西，因爲它不是客觀世界的一部分，那是對世界的觀點，它從這些眼睛看向你，但從一個紫色的地方看，不在這個世界上，這就是奇特的奧祕，這就是爲什麼以這種方式看對方眼睛的人無法停止這樣做，因爲他們看的東西不在那裏，但它是它。他們回過頭來看他們，所以有一種奇特的形而上學的疑惑從這裏產生，你必須適合它 你知道看着別人的眼睛需要某種形而上學的努力 你在看着對方的目光 那是沃格納的《毀滅上帝》中一個非常雄辯的時刻，正如你們中受過適當教育的人所知道的，巨人族得到了星雲的黃金，作爲交換 作爲交換，他們必須擁有愛神弗里爾 他們在她面前堆起了這堆黃金 如果她被他們藏起來，他們就會同意拿走黃金而不是她 但有一個小裂縫，深愛她的法索爾德仍然可以看到她的目光 她的目光落在他身上，就像你在德語中說的那樣，她的眨眼，因此你不能接受這個替代品
   這枚戒指是整部劇的主題 它是用來交換放棄愛情的東西 所以它是唯一可以作爲愛情代價的東西 所以它也被放進了這堆東西里 如何填滿這個洞 換句話說，這一眼，弗萊爾是包含她的本質的東西 我想大多數人都認識到，這裏有一些東西，我們都會對它作出反應，這對情慾的戲劇性感覺非常重要，所以，儘管如此，真誠的微笑，這反而是我對這個天使的看法，真誠的微笑雖然是對別人的微笑，但不一定是自願的，而且 它不應該完全是自願的 它必須有一個非自願的因素 這有點像臉紅 米爾頓可能說過，臉紅來自理性的流動，是愛的食物 他們也是兩個被否認的布魯特 雖然你知道那些幸運的動物有半透明的皮膚 可以像我們的豬那樣臉紅 臉紅是隻有我們有自我意識的人才能做的事，但臉紅是不由自主的，你不能故意這樣做，這是非常奇怪的事。 笑容也是如此，真正的笑容是由對方召喚出來的，而不是你去爲他裝出來的，如果你這樣做了，那麼這種關係就已經有問題了，或者你在宣稱一種優越感。你不應該宣稱的 所以是自我意識的眼睛出現在微笑中 對事物的微笑 是來自內心的光 我想朱利安在談話中說了一些關於這個的事情 是否有來自眼睛的光 Andraia Tallis放棄了對任何科學解釋的想法 這當然沒有科學的解釋，我們談論的不是物體，我們談論的是主體，沒有任何東西可以輻射，沒有任何東西可以從眼睛裏輻射出來，當你面對這些眼睛時，主體的眼睛是什麼，因爲這個物體不在那裏，所以有一個很大的困難。所以在藝術中捕捉微笑是非常困難的 真正的微笑是由它的對象召喚出來的 它是對自我的召喚，進入眼睛和臉部 所以微笑的天使也許是對世界的一種普遍的微笑 我們真的可以相信它嗎？ 當然，這有一些非常美麗的東西，毫無疑問，但這有點像席勒的《歡樂頌》中的那個時刻，當他哭着說："我的孩子們，你們的孩子們，你們的孩子們。我想給你一個難得的成功例子，這就是倫勃朗的母親，當然，這與自拍的所有規範相差甚遠。自拍的所有標準都在這裏被違反了，這是個真正的、終生奉獻的跡象，克服了苦難，得到了回報，但在這個老態龍鍾的臉上，她對她的兒子仍有一點微笑，這是你知道的，她整個人都在散發着一種自豪感。這裏是一個很好的例子，有人像倫勃朗一樣捕捉到了某人的肉體，他的自我形象體現在其中，我認爲他爲我說明了我想說的關於微笑的問題，我現在要趕去完成我要說的，然後回到 米爾頓-米爾頓強調的事實是，我們對對方微笑，而不是對對方的臉微笑，因爲那是在嘲笑他，如果我對你的臉微笑，那和對你微笑不一樣，如果你喜歡我通過你的臉微笑，這是一個例子。這是一個例子 人與人之間相同的身體關係可能屬於兩個完全不同的世界 你可以想象一個人出於任何原因對另一個人的臉微笑 你知道，諷刺地不屑一顧，不管怎樣 通過他的臉，好像有什麼東西在那張臉上顯露出來 實際上不屬於那裏，也不屬於其他地方 接吻也是如此 你可以在你面前親吻臉，就像你親吻主教的戒指一樣 你知道，或者其他什麼，你可以親吻對方的臉 吻是一種召喚 我之前提到過但丁的例子 但很明顯的例子是保羅和弗朗西斯卡在《地獄》第五卷中 她說一起重讀這本淘氣的書 她讀到吉尼維爾被這樣一個男人吻過的笑容 然後她想到了自己的笑容 突然間，弗朗西斯科-保羅來到她身邊 他的嘴貼在她身上，就像拉瓦卡-我的單身漢一樣浪漫 他的嘴在她身上顫抖 她陷入了一種不同的狀態 她突然變成了肉體 我想到了一個微笑，我想大多數人都知道這個故事，當然是由柴可夫斯基以音調詩的形式表現出來的，在歌劇中跑掉了，等等，所以她摔倒了，變成了肉體，你知道吻是這樣的，他們也是在肉體和關係之間的邊緣。是肉體之間的關係和主體之間的關係，一個人的眼睛與另一個人的你相遇，薩特說，在伊拉克的色情愛撫中，我們把另一個人化身爲她的肉體，我們就像這樣把主觀的觀點變成了我們觸摸的一部分。但它不可能成爲我們所接觸的思想的一部分 因爲它屬於自我的虛無 但這意味着對你來說，吻是一種有意的行爲 有可能是錯誤的吻 盧克麗霞在吻那個突然從戰場上回來的男人時 對不起，我想那是她的丈夫，但她突然發現那是強姦犯塔昆，那是她給他的一個錯誤的吻，等等，所以在這些事情中，比如微笑、親吻和觸摸等等，總是有這樣的焦慮，我們打算作爲我和你之間的主體關係，可能會突然淪爲對象之間的關係，我想我們大多數人現在都意識到了這一點，因爲我們周圍的色情文化越來越多，等等，我們被邀請把這些關係僅僅看成是事物和對象的關係 你知道，從眼睛和你的世界落入事物的世界，所以回到微笑，最後有一些想法，顯然有很多不同類型的微笑，有普通的日常交易的微笑，當你工作購物時，向談判開放自己，如果你微笑，你會自發地微笑，你的微笑被櫃檯另一邊的人召喚出來，當你遞上錢，她遞上雞蛋，不管是什麼，這些都是誠實善良的微笑。 但它們不是，它們也是交易的一部分 不像倫勃朗的媽媽的這個微笑，那是一個禮物的微笑，是免費贈送的東西 自拍的微笑不是贈送的噪音，是交易的一部分 它是一種讓自己看起來無害的方式，但也是消失在微笑背後的方式，所以你不是一個保險絲的設施 在這個意義上，有一些伊斯蘭的東西 我認爲我們看到的自拍文化的結果之一是微笑的增長，不僅僅是自拍，而是整個無害的文化，我們被鼓勵參與其中，微笑是一種面具，我們學會戴上它，以轉移任何挑戰。我說過，我們把自己的臉藏在微笑後面，同時，臉對我們來說對社會絕對是至關重要的，在我們成長的文化中，我們是在一個面對面的社會中長大的，在這個社會中，我們確實站在對方面前，在臉上暴露自我，這是我們認爲我們必須做的事情，是我們的第二天性。自拍也許是一種自發傳播的方式，但它不僅如此，正如你所看到的，還有一種自拍的方式，在那裏沒有臉被觀察，我認爲這是我們現在需要考慮的事情之一。你知道，面紗進入歐洲的生活是近年來最令人不安的發展之一，它對我們做了什麼？我們對這個事實感到震驚，在與他人的關係中成爲一個自我的整個過程，因爲我們中間出現了一些人，雖然他們在公共領域，但他們是絕對的私人，我想這是我們應該思考的問題之一，現在我說得夠多了，你好，羅傑，你說了一點，我覺得 我在這裏，我想引用艾倫-布盧姆的話，我知道我已經在以前的各種採訪中讓你筋疲力盡了，但艾倫-布盧姆寫道，他寫道，一個人可以產生宇宙和理想的圖像，並以此作爲天才的生活。一個神祕的惡魔般的存在，這樣一個人的偉大是藝術家自己的工作，他可以把他的人當作一個混亂的印象和慾望的東西，他的統一性是值得懷疑的，給一個秩序和統一性是一個人格，我想知道你是否認爲現代的趨勢，例如無論是當代藝術還是即時通訊，都未能給我們提供真實的自我 表達，正是因爲敘事的概念被打破了，因爲我們不僅沒有嘗試個性，而且我們甚至沒有一個基本的概念，即什麼是什麼？
   很明顯，這說明了伊恩昨天所說的文化傳遞的悲觀主義，人們沒有連貫的敘事，或者說沒有能力創造這種敘事，這並不是一個普遍的事實。我的生活就是這樣，它不是一個連貫的敘事，而是有趣的不連貫 你知道，這些年來我一直堅持着它，現在我在這裏，我想我們繼續下去，可能是這樣的，如果你只是在你身後留下了 如果你在生活中留下一些你已經忘記了的零散的影像，而且它們只存在於相機上，那麼就會有一些類似於構成你的存在的敘述的崩潰，但我不確定你看到的人，解決整個存在問題的一個方法是像和尚一樣過着宗教般的虔誠生活 你早晚都做同樣的祈禱，每天都有同樣的節奏，你擁有的只是背誦的文字、聖歌和聖典，那是一種敘述，任何人在任何時候都可以得到它，現在也可以。今天，我想在這個島上有一些人在從事這種工作，然而你知道我們卻偏離了這一點，我們認爲這對你來說是不夠的，讓我們說我們是冒險家和不信教的人等等，所以我們出去創造另一種新的敘述，我們 我們必須把它的各個部分組合在一起，但它們並不總是合適的 但我不認爲以前的人比我們更有能力做到這一點 你知道這取決於我們，羅傑 在這個即時通訊的時代，大多數人，現在我們知道大多數人，因爲我們有一個巨大的網絡，像Facebook或Twitter或任何東西，大多數人不是藝術家，也不是哲學家，也不是作家，但他們仍然覺得他們需要以某種方式表達自己，他們沒有被賦予某些天賦，能夠表達自己，比如在Duracell描繪或說寫一首可愛的詩或寫一個好故事，所以他們唯一可以向朋友表達自己或自我的方式 他們表達的方式純粹是通過他們的自拍和他們自己的小狀態，比如說我今天早上醒來，我吃了奶酪和吐司，因爲我宿醉了，這肯定和任何有創造性人才或智力人才的人一樣有價值，就像電線一樣，爲什麼對那些沒有的人有那麼多審查，他們必須日復一日地工作，作爲一個 爲什麼會有這麼多的審查，而不是那些試圖自我表達的人 你沒有這樣的天賦 是的，所有這些都是完全合理的觀點 我並沒有真正提出這個觀點，或者與之相反 我的意思是，我想說微笑有不同的意義 當你對某人微笑並通過微笑創造一種關係時，和你對着鏡頭說 "茄子 "時的意義是不同的 我想解釋爲什麼這些是不同的事情，爲什麼微笑是人類特有的東西，爲什麼給我們提出了這樣一個偉大的問題：我們是什麼樣的東西，在一個物體的世界裏成爲一個主體是什麼？是的，也許自拍是一種治療某些缺陷的方法，或者是與世界聯繫的另一種方式，所以我只是......我已經拿到了麥克風，所以我會從這裏開始，但是這個 "來自理性的微笑 "我不太記得米爾頓的背景，但是它讓我想起了這個問題，即微笑和笑聲之間的聯繫，然後就是 笑的不協調理論認爲，只有人類能笑，因爲只有人類有識別不協調的理由，這意味着動物不能笑，上帝也不能笑，因爲對上帝來說沒有什麼是不協調的，所以我想知道你認爲微笑和更高級的笑的形式，甚至是喜劇之間的聯繫可能是什麼。我想知道，你對我們微笑時發生的事情的看法沒有那麼浪漫，但我確實想知道，如果你是比較形而上學的人，你可以通過思考我們微笑時所做的事情的一部分來支持，即認識到我們作爲主體而不是作爲客體遇到對方之間的這種不協調性，並且有一些東西將我們與笑聲聯繫起來，然後我們 然後發展成藝術形式，也考慮到了林肯-布羅迪 所以有一個完整的笑的理論，我可能會同意，但不確定我認爲我說的那種微笑不是笑的副產品，也不是笑的前兆，它本身就是一種活動，你知道有一些人完全沒有幽默感，他們可以 我同意，理解笑是什麼是一個巨大的問題，它顯然是我們可以做的事情，而動物是否會做則是一個問題，因爲它們是否有娛樂的概念，而娛樂的概念是否如你所說是一個收入增長的問題，等等，這些都是很深的問題，我還沒有一個現成的答案。 是的，我想說的是，微笑並不是簡單的一件事，是一種生理學上的Mahtob，這種生理學上的Naama被稱爲步伐的分配，即使沒有微笑也可以存在，因爲微笑是主體走到那個步伐中，把自己送給對方的禮物
   
   thank you very much Alan that's a search Lee and encomium that I can't possibly do anything except refuted but still I'm going to just introduce a few thoughts about smiling and this is that my title comes from Milton's Paradise Lost in which he is describing the love growing between Adam and Eve in Paradise and and the communication to each other through smiling and he says at once - smiles from reason flow - brute denied and are of love the food in other words we reasoning self conscious beings can smile animals can't and because we can smile we feed our mutual love on that activity this is our where is it this is a way in which love grows between people and I think this is an extremely interesting observation very relevant to our topic it suggests that smile smiling is a relation between subjects you know we are already in a little panel discussion raised this question of what the self is and the idea that the self is that aspect of the human being which is connected with subjectivity being being a subject as opposed to an object having a point of view on the world as opposed to being merely one item among others in the world those are all difficult philosophical ideas and I can't say that they've ever been explained to anyone's satisfaction but nevertheless we instinctively understand them we understand that words like I and you are as it were singling us out from the ordinary flow of nature and putting us into a different light we already had a little example of it with the famous poem by Rilke set by Schubert du bist II who designs of do you know the designs of do and vanish don't you at you are the calm it's that it's addressed to the you and as though she through being the object of his love has stood out from everything she is the cause of everything in him and also the thing that fulfills it and of course Schubert setting makes it very clear that this is a very special thing this isn't something that can even be described from the third person point of view it has to be described from the first or the second person now smiling is a very interesting thing it's something that we do and I think we should distinguish smiling as a general feature of the human face from smiling at things the word at is an extremely difficult one to understand you know what is the difference between just smiling and smiling at someone it doesn't it didn't mean that there is somebody that you're actually smiling at there might be nobody there but you could still be smiling at them because you think they're there we've made them you've made a mistake you can be smiling at an invisible person or someone in your memory so this this word at it has that peculiar feature that philosophers call intentionality the future of being directed outwards without necessarily finding a target as it were creating a space in the world into which something else can fit even if it there is nothing there to fit and this means that there is a possibility of error you can smile in in error you smile at the wrong person you know and perhaps your life could depend on that and there are there are a lot of errors like this Ritesh will refer to later and the possibility of error is one of the things that distinguishes our states of mind from most of the states of minds that animals have because we build on our state of mind or conception of the world and try to make ourselves part of that conception I said we were being talking about the selfie idea which always seems to involve smiling if people say that smiling at the camera in this way that this is the the trees idea you know you can't stand before a camera without distorting your face in this way no small animal could confront this without fear it is not if you take it back to its biological origin this is clearly one of the things that condemns our species or ought to condemn it to extinction but nevertheless for some reason we feel that this is absolutely necessary especially when confronted by a mere machine this isn't establishing any relationship with anybody but it's we think of it at least the people who do this they think we're just showing themselves as in some way agreeable harmless we're not a threat you know we're a threat to rabbits and and so on but we're not a threat to our fellow human beings but even politicians now have to appear with a smile and it all photographs or their public photographs are smiling photographs but are they really smiling at anything and is it in fact a smile if you're not actually smiling at something other than a camera I think most of us would think that for the ordinary politician smiling is a way of avoiding people rather than relating to them it's a way of pulling a veil over your face which represents you as something generally agreeable but nevertheless not to be interrupted and this is a very new thing that photographs have to do this the old idea of a photographic portrait was that you sat in a dignified way properly dressed in order to represent yourself as a citizen as somebody who's got a position in life is how people used to sit for photographs they're not pretending to a relation with the camera still less with the person behind it and obviously there's very little relation to each other you know they are representing the ordinary disaster of an ordinary human life here here we are I'm sorry we didn't manage but there it is so you're making the best of your social meaning but retreating from any kind of encounter there's no I to you encounter there and in the modern world we don't have anything quite like this because we're always looking at the camera we can't actually present those socially informed postures always we're always directing ourselves towards the camera so if we want to be serious we are or look as though you know we've got something to offer it's usually a Pelt rather than a smile sexual meaning like this and the pout in the world of the model and the pop star this is the you know we find the non smiling photo but his meaning is usually slightly threatening also sexual and only young people pop groups this is their normal posture this is how they relate to the world and what those are in a way sincere expressions there are serious sincere expressions of their music not necessarily of the people who produce it so let's go back or go back to smiles so there there are two kinds of smiling in other words they're smiling in general of which smiling into a camera might be an example and smiling at someone even animals can seem to be smiling in general and people often this is said Oh obviously not distinguishable from that selfie we started with really but of course this dog isn't smiling at another person nor is it understood as smiling and people are aware of this so that they kind of paint smiles they're in this sort of way and as you is obvious from that picture that is the best that an animal can do by way of smiling and it's not smiling at anything and we can paint a smile on our face in that way as well it certainly doesn't endear the the wearer of the makeup to anyone but it is something that people sometimes get involved in so what ended Milton mean by saying that smiles from reason flow right this is an angel from this Cathedral amps the smiling angel who is carrying the blessing of the Almighty to the world in general now is that a real smile this is something with it I think it's worth thinking about what Milton meant was that the smile that that Adam and Eve confer on each other the smiles that they confer on each other are part of their interpersonal relation part of the way that they look at each other and where from their looks their grows the love between them now I think there's looking at another person is a very also extremely interesting phenomenon all animals with eyes look at things they look at things to gather information and you know they respond to the changes in information in their environment but there's another kind of looking which they can't or don't seem to be able to do which is looking into another person's eyes a lot of people imagine that their dog is looking into their eyes when it's eager for food or whatever and they do have some that penetrating way of addressing you but they're not looking into your eyes in the way that you look into the eyes of someone you love in order to communicate with them the fact that you love them they're looking into another is a very strange phenomenon with John Donne describes it when he describes it him and his mistress sitting looking at each other that hour-by-hour eyebeams twisted and to thread our eyes upon one double string that thought of just sitting face to face looking into each other's eyes and they're growing between you the sense that of belonging when you're looking into someone's eyes in that sense you're not like an optician looking with a little torch to see if there's some damage to the retina or anything like that there's nothing you're trying to see no object you're trying to see but that's the that's the crucial thing there's no object you're trying to see so what are you trying to see it's the subject it's the thing that you can't see because it's not part of the objective world it's that point of view on the world which looks from these eyes at you but looks from a purple place that is not in the world that is the peculiar mystery and it's why people who look into each other's eyes in this way can't stop doing it because the thing that they're looking at isn't there and yet it it is they're looking back at them so that there's a peculiar kind of metaphysical queasiness that comes out of this and you've got to be fit for it you know looking at looking into someone's eyes requires a certain kind of metaphysical strenuousness you're looking at the gaze of the other that's a very eloquent moment in in destroying God by vogner in which as those of you who are properly educated will know they the Giants have been given the gold of the of the nebula and in exchange for the contract that they had to have the goddess of love frier and they build up this pile of gold in front of her and if she is hidden from them then they will agree to take the gold instead of her but there's a little crack through which fassold who loves her dearly can still see her gaze still her eye falls upon him her blink as they as you say in German and therefore you can't accept the substitute but there is one thing that can be put in to fill that gap which is the ring on votans finger the ring of which is the subject of the whole drama which was the thing given in exchange for renouncing love so it's the only thing that can be a price of love so that is put in on the pile too how to fill up this hole in other words this the glance that of fryer is the thing which contains the essence of her of her lovable nurse right so and I think most people recognize that there is some something here which we all respond to of great importance for the drama of erotic feeling right so but nevertheless sincere smiles this is rather I get on to this angel a sincere smile although it's smiling at someone is not necessarily voluntary and that it shouldn't be entirely voluntary it has to have an element of involuntariness and it's a bit like blushing milton could have said that blushes from reason flow and are of love the food they are also two Brut denied although you know animals that are fortunate enough to have translucent skin can flush like our pigs used to were never given sufficient claret they are they would flush beautifully but they weren't blushing blushing is something that only our self conscious being can do but a blush is an involuntary thing you can't do it deliberately this is a very strange thing there are lots of things like that especially in the face which are revelations of self-consciousness even though they have to be involuntary to be so and a smile is like that a real smile is called forth from you by the other it's not something that you go and and put on for him if you're doing that there's something already that that is wrong with the relationship or what you're claiming a kind of superiority which you shouldn't be claiming so it's the self conscious eye that appears in the smile the smiling at things it's the light from within I think Julian said some things in the conversation about about this whether there was a light that came from the eye and andraia Tallis backed off the idea of any scientific explanation of this of course there's no scientific explanation who are not talking about objects we're talking about subjects there isn't anything that radiates there's no thing that radiates from the from the eyes when you confront in those eyes the subject whose eyes they are because this object isn't there so there's a great difficulty therefore of capturing a smile in art that the real smile is called forth by its object it is a summons of the self into the eye and into the face so the smiling angel perhaps is bestowing a general smile on the world and can we really believe it I I've seen this used it in an advert someone saying you know would you buy a second-hand car from this guy claiming to be a better dealer in them you know and of course there is something very beautiful about this and undoubtedly but but it's a little bit like that moment in in the Schiller ode to joy' when he cries zai Jian Shuang and million and you know millions of you be embraced how can there be such a command and they even make sense of it of course but only in his naive way I want to give you one rare example of success in portraying of a real smile and this this is Rembrandt's mother and of course this is a million miles from the selfie all the norms of the selfie are here violated this every sign of a real and lifelong devotion of suffering overcome and rewarded and yet in this old pinch gray and face has this little smile still there for her son which which is you know her whole being radiates there's a kind of pride in her as well so the here is a very good example somebody capturing as Rembrandt always did in the very flesh of someone the self hood that that's embodied in it and that I think his illustrates for me what I'm trying to say about the smile and I'll rush on now just to finish what I have to say and back to Milton Milton is emphasizing the fact that we smile at the other person we don't smile at the other person's face because that would be to mock him if I smiled at your face that isn't the same as smiling at you if you like I'm smiling through your face it's example this is an example the way in which one on the same physical relation between people might actually be belong to two quite different worlds you can imagine someone smiling at another person's face for whatever reason you know ironically dismissively whatever and someone's smiling at the other person in his face well through his face it's as though something is revealed in that face that doesn't actually belong there nor does it belong anywhere else and the same is true of kissing you can kiss the face before you like as you kiss the bishop's ring you know or whatever or you can kiss the other in her face the kiss is a kind of summons very good example of this I was referred to Dante before but the very obvious example is see that a Paolo and Francesca in the fifth book of the inferno where she says rereading the this naughty book together and she reads of the smile of Guinevere kissed by such a such a man and then she thinks of her own smile and suddenly Francesco Paulo rather so I is upon her and it's his mouth pressed on unto her as lavaca me Bachelorette romantic his his mouth trembling against hers and she falls into into a different condition she becomes flesh suddenly having thought about a smile I got a picture that and I think most people know this story beautifully presented of course by Tchaikovsky and in a tone poem by running off in an opera and so on so she falls and becomes flesh and you know kisses are like that they are also on the verge between being relations between flesh and relations between subjects that the the the eye of the one person meeting the the you of the other a Sartre says that in Iraq the erotic caress we are incarnated the other person into her flesh we are as it were making that subjective point of view part of what we touch and yet it can't be part of your thought we touch because it belongs to that the nothingness of the of the self but it this means that there's an intentionality about kisses to you there can be mistaken kisses Lucretia when she kisses the man who comes suddenly back from the battlefield thinking his Tarquin sorry I think it's her husband suddenly discovers it is Tarquin the rapist that was a mistaken kiss she gave him and so on so there's always in these things like smiling and kissing and touching and so on there's always this anxiety that what we intend as a relation between subjects between I and you might suddenly fall into a relation between objects and I think most of us have are aware of this now because of the growing culture of pornography and so on all around us that somehow we're being invited to see these relations merely as relations of things and objects and you know the fall the fall into the into the world of things from the world of the eye and the you so back to smiles a few final thoughts and the there are obviously lots of different clients types of smile there is the ordinary day to day smile of the transaction when you're working shopping opening yourself to negotiation it's better if you smile and you do smile spontaneously your smile is called forth by the person on the other side of the counter as you hand over the money and she hands over the eggs whatever it might be these are these are honest good-natured smiles but they are not they are also part of a transaction not like this smile of Rembrandt's mum which was a gift smile something given for free the selfie smile isn't a given noise a part of a transaction it's a way of of making it the self look harmless but also vanishing behind the smile so you're not a fuse amenity there's some Isles in that in that sense become kind of mask not like the theatre mask which has to be read but but a kind of fail and that's that I think is that the what we are seeing one of the results of the selfie culture is the growth of the smile it's not just the selfie but the the whole culture of of harmlessness that we're being encouraged to engage in that smiles are a kind of a mask that we learn to wear in order to deflect any challenge I said that we hide our face behind a smile at the same time the face for us is absolutely vital to the society in the culture in which we've been raised we've been raised in a face to face society one in which we do stand before each other revealing the self in the face and that's something that we we think we must do and we second nature to us to do it and the selfie is perhaps a way in which that has has just propagated itself spontaneously however it's not only as you see there is such a thing as the selfie will where there is no face to be observed and this I think is one of the things that we need now have to take into account well what is the concept of the self which is being rehearsed and rejoiced in here and you know the the entry of the veil into the life of Europe has been one of the most troubled developments in recent years what has it done to us this the fact that we who related to each other by looking into each other's eyes and smiling into each other's spaces have suddenly found ourselves surrounded by people whom we cannot see inevitably we are alarmed by this by the fact that this whole process of becoming a self in relation to others has been compromised by the presence among us of people who are resolutely private even though they are in the public sphere and I think that is one of the things that perhaps we should be thinking about now that's enough of me hi Roger so you spoke a little bit about I feel as they imply that a very sharp distinction between the universe on the particular and individuality and the universal I'm over here and I wanted to quote Allan bloom to you which I know I've already exhausted you with in various previous interviews but Allan bloom writes the following he writes a man who can generate images of a cosmos and ideals by which to live as a genius a mysterious demonic being such a man's greatness work of artists himself he who can take his person a chaos of impressions and desires the thing who's very unity is doubtful and to give an order and unity is a personality and I'm wondering whether do you think that modern trends such as whether it's contemporary art or instant munication failed to give us authentic self-expression precisely because the concept of narrative has broken down and because we not only do we not attempt personality but we don't even have a basic concept of what would that what that would represent to be unified self with a certain narrative and a personified story to tell well obviously that illustrates what Ian was saying yesterday about cultural passes pessimism it's not jet it's not universally true that people don't have a coherent narrative or not capable of creating that narrative in modern circumstances my life is a it's not a coherent narrative but it's interestingly incoherent you know and I've clung to it over the years and Here I am and I think we we go on it may be the case that if you just leave behind you through life scattered images of moments that you've forgotten and they're only there on a camera that there is something like a breakdown of the narrative which constitutes your being but I'm not sure you see people one way of solving the whole problem of existence is to live a life of religious piety like a monk you say the same prayers morning and night that each day has the same rhythm all you have is the memorized words the chants the holy texts and that's a narrative you know and that's available to anyone at any time and it's still available today I think there are some people here on this island engaged in that and yet you know we we branch away from that we think no that's inadequate for you know we let us say we adventurous people and unbelievers and so on so we go out and create another nerrit narrative and we try that we have to make the parts of it together and they don't always fit together but I don't think people in previous epochs were any better positioned to do this than we are you know it's up for us Roger Roger but don't you think and the sort of the question of self expression in there in the age of instant communication that most people most people and now we know about most people because we're in have a huge vast sort of web like Facebook or Twitter or anything most people aren't artists nor philosophers nor writers but they still feel like they need to express themselves in some way and they haven't been blessed with certain talents to be able to express themselves say in the duracell portray or say to write a lovely poem or to write a good story so the only way they can express themselves to their friends or self-expression is purely for a selfie impurity through their and their own little status like oh I woke up this morning and I had cheese and toast because I was hungover that surely that's has as much worth as anyone who is blessed with and with creative talents or intellectual talents like wires and why is there so much scrutiny over someone who hasn't who has to work day in day out as a dustman or what or what have you as a nurse or what have you wanted so much scrutiny over those people who try to and to try to self express themselves you haven't been blessed with such a talent yeah yeah all that is perfectly legitimate point to make I wasn't really making that point though or the opposite of it I mean I was trying to say that that smiles have a different significance when you are smiling at someone and creating a relationship through that smile and they have when you're looking into a camera and saying cheese and I was trying to explain why these are different things and why smiling at is a peculiarly human thing and why presents us with this great question of what kind of thing we are what is it to be a subject in a world of objects and yeah it may be that the selfie is a is a cure for certain lacks or another way of relating to the world that could be so I'll just I've got the microphone so I'll I'll start here anyway but this smiles from reason flow I don't remember the context in Milton well enough but the thing it brings to mind for me is this the question of the connection between smiles and laughter and then the incongruity theory of laughter which suggests that only humans can laugh because only humans have the reason to identify incongruity is this means that animals can't laugh and also God can't laugh because nothing can be incongruous to God and so I wondered what you thought the connection between smiling and more advanced forms of laughter and even in comedy than might be and I wondered that's a much less romantic view of what is going on when we smile than the one you gave us but I did wonder if if you're more metaphysical you could be bolstered by thinking that part of what we do when we smile is recognize this incongruity between our encountering each other as subjects as opposed to as objects and there's something about that that connects us to the laughter that we then develop into art forms that also take this Lincoln Brodie into account well so there's a complete theory of laughter which I might go along with not sure I think that the sort of smiling I was talking about is not if you like a byproduct of laughter nor is it a premonition of laughter it's a an activity in its own right and you know there are people totally humorless people who can smile in the CET sense that I was talking about laughter is I agree it's a huge problem to understand quite what it is and it clearly is something that we can do and it's questionable whether animals do it because do they have the concept of amusement and is the concept of amusement as you say a matter of income growth a and and so on those are deep questions and I haven't got a ready-made answer to them but yeah there we are what all I wanted to say is that a smile is not simply a thing a physio Mahtob such a physio naama called distributive distribution of patches of the pace that can be in existence even though there is no smile because the smile is the subject coming forward into that pace and making a gift of itself to the other
